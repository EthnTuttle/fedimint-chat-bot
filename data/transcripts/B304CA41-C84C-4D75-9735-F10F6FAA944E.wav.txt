 Hello and welcome back to On The Brink, I'm Nick Carter.
 Today we're sitting down with Obi Nuosu, formerly the CEO of CoinFloor, which was the exchange
 doing the longest running proof of reserve at a station.
 Obi is now the founder of Fedi, a company building on top of FediMint, designed to build
 collaborative custody tools for people to use Bitcoin safely and at scale.
 FediMint draws on ideas from pre-Bitcoin, dating back to David Chom.
 I've always thought that Chomian banks were an overlooked scaling technology for Bitcoin,
 and I'm very excited to see what Obi and the team do with Fedi.
 I think this could be the dawning of a new model of custody and hopefully the reemergence
 of Chomian banks on Bitcoin as an alternative scaling model.
 Let's dive right into it.
 Obi, welcome.
 It's good to see you.
 Thank you.
 Thanks for having me.
 I'm excited to be here.
 I'm excited to be here.
 I've been here for a while.
 I've been here for a while.
 I've been here for a while.
 I've been here for a while.
 I've been here for a while.

 I've been here for a while.
 I've been here for a while.
 I've been here for a while.
 I've been here for a while.
 It was very cold.
 Yeah, I actually thought that I would, my muscles would seize up and I would drown.
 I think if you spent more than, more than a few minutes there, you would lose the ability
 to, to swim.
 Yeah, I could do about a minute at a time, I think.
 But I suffer from something called Reynard syndrome.
 So my extremities, well, hands and, let's be clear, my hands and feet, those extremities
 get very, very cold very easily.
 So, so 30 seconds was me.
 I was in and out.
 For example, I like skiing, but I could never do it because I'll do one slope and then spend
 30, 40 minutes in the apres ski and then one other slope.
 It's just not very enjoyable.
 Well, you've been busy since then.
 I don't know when it was exactly, or a little over.
 End of May.
 Yeah, wow.
 So it's been a couple of months.
 You started a new company.
 And you're the talk of the town in Bitcoin land, because it's not every day that sort
 of new, you know, ways to deal with Bitcoin come around, you know, new custodial setup.
 So now, now we have second party custody.
 Originally we had first and third party, now we have second party.
 Yeah.
 It's a bit of a combination.
 It's unusual in the Bitcoin space.
 I have a distinct impression that people start to, over the next 18 months in other spaces,
 pay a lot more attention to it as well.
 Yeah, I mean, it is a coincidence, but it isn't that Fedi is an anagram of DeFi.
 I'll leave it at that.
 That's interesting.
 I was gonna ask you about that.
 So let's zoom out.
 Let's rewind.
 So when we met first time was in New York in 2018, maybe was that it?
 Around Consensus.
 You remember that?
 Oh, yeah.
 I think in person.
 Yeah.
 Was it in a diner?
 It was in a diner and it was raining a lot.
 I think it was Consensus 2018.
 It was Consensus.
 Yeah.
 I was extremely damp.
 That's what I remember.
 And you were running Coinfloor.
 And I think I wanted to talk because you had been doing Proof of Reserve for four years
 at that point.
 Yeah.
 And I was very impressed by that.
 So to what extent did your experience with Coinfloor actually influence your thinking
 around around Fediment?
 I guess let's start there.
 So first of all, it did have a great impact.
 So if we're talking about Coinfloor specifically, when I started the first page, the first notebook
 book, because I used to make copious notes in Coinfloor, had this...
 I still have it actually.
 It was a diagram of BTC and then this arrow pointing down to the Nigerian Naira, because
 my sort of heritage is from Nigeria.
 And then an arrow pointing back to BTC.
 Because for me, it seemed obvious that this solved a lot of problems in countries like
 Nigeria, but I knew most about Nigeria.
 I then went on with my co-founders to form Coinfloor and we had great aspirations of
 focusing on the UK first and then expanding.
 But with mainly traditional finance investors and shareholders, Nigeria's your second market
 from the UK and the City of London, Nigeria's your second market was just never going to
 happen.
 It was going to be Europe, maybe US, but Nigeria, global south, don't need that, not
 much money and lots of risk.
 So in that sense, realizing that the things that I was most interested in and the people
 I most wanted to help were never going to be helped by me staying in this sort of very
 much institutional Bitcoin central limit order book exchange environment eventually made
 me jump, find the opportunity.
 It was a great opportunity to sell and I sold and I committed to the beginning of this year,
 focusing on all Bitcoin, all empowering the global south, all with global impact all the
 time.
 So that's why everything I do is that from now on.
 And I'm thousands of times happier because of that.
 But beyond that, I dealt with a lot with regulators.
 I gave evidence in front of the Treasury Select Committee, which is the UK equivalent of Senate
 hearings, I guess, in the US, BBC, Parliament and all that stuff.
 We gave advice to members of the intelligence services, to the police, to regulators, the
 Bank of England and everybody in between.
 We were always the head of the queue when it came to regulation.
 We were the first exchange regulated in Gibraltar and we were dealing with basically every regulator
 in Europe and US.
 And I also saw the behavior of other high brand, high profile exchanges, Bitcoin and
 crypto exchanges.
 And those two things by the end of, already was starting after four years when I met you,
 but by the end of eight years, it was very clear that we needed another option other
 than regulated exchanges.
 We needed it to use it in Americanism, we needed it stat.
 So that was another thing.
 They were not something that I felt comfortable most people holding their money in regulated
 exchanges knowing what I knew about the majority of them.
 Yeah, it's interesting.
 You kind of went through this real journey running CoinFloor and trying to create the
 most credible centralized model possible.
 You did those proof of reserve out of stations for years and years.
 But despite that, your thinking landed on, we need a different model here that's not
 as custodial.
 It's not the pure third party custody.
 Yeah, I guess you said it yourself.
 What's not obvious and what's uncommon knowledge is that I don't want to go as far as to say
 it's an oxymoron, but credible centralized is the problem.
 It's really hard to be credible and also centralized.
 And I do think some manage.
 But you're fighting against a lot of enforcers and incentives to make you follow the path
 of the dark side.
 Yeah, it's I mean, it's a timely, we're having this conversation at a really critical moment
 when, you know, we kind of expected this would happen.
 But now with the rise of proof of stake with Ethereum making that switch, you have exchanges
 being deputized to basically engage in protocol level censorship at the behest of the state.
 You know, it's the most aggressive time of state level attack on blockchains I think
 we've ever seen in the sort of 13 year history of this industry.
 Yeah.
 And I mean, I've had views around this.
 I ultimately think that there is a significant risk that that will continue to get more and
 more severe.
 So if you're not, and the way to counteract that, well, the way that will appear is two
 things.
 It would appear in the form of misinformation and it will appear in a form of extreme regulation
 because you're attacking an idea and the only way you can attack, you can't attack an idea
 of a nuclear missile or a gun, you have to attack it with misinformation and regulation.
 And you only have to look around to see that both of those things are increasing at an
 ever, ever more rapid rate.
 So the other thing is just from a personal ring of Soromon or ring of Soromon like effect,
 having that much power, the ability to know what every one of your customers is doing
 and the ability to stop and start transactions and holding onto very, very large amounts
 of money is a massive set of temptations.
 And even if you start as the heart of a hobbit, over time, you're going to, it's going to
 turn it, you're going to become Gollum.
 And I could feel that happening to me.
 I like to think I have very strong ethics and a way to solve that is to do a quick sidestep
 and move on to something where you limit your ability to act in a bad, socially bad way.
 Yeah, that's a fun analogy.
 I think in this analogy, you're Frodo, who, you know, is pretty resistant ultimately to
 the power of the ring, or maybe Tom Bombadil, he's not in the movies, in the books, he's
 unworried by the ring.
 Or we can take it forward to a sort of Star Wars metaphors.
 Contrary to popular belief, I don't think I'd be Obi-Wan Kenobi.
 I'd be more likely Mace Windu, you know, visually I look like Mace Windu.
 I like Mace.
 But I mean, structurally at this age, in Bitcoin terms, I'm more like Yoda, because I'm the
 oldest, like, far the oldest person in the team.
 So you thought Nigeria would be the sort of heartland of Bitcoin adoption.
 That turned out to be completely true, basically.
 I mean, it's maybe the number one per capita Bitcoin place in the world.
 A hundred percent.
 The part of the world that I thought had the most opportunity for growth has been seeing
 that.
 And I think because for a long time, not many people were paying attention.
 A few organizations like, you know, the Paxfuls and Bitrefills have paid attention.
 And now you're seeing more and more regional players in Nigeria, specifically, you've got
 people like Bitnob, and so on.
 But it's all happened over the last few years without my involvement.
 And I would have loved to been, other than saying it's going to happen and writing some
 blog posts predicting it happening.
 I haven't been part of that, but it's going to be, that is something I will definitely
 be rapidly remedying over the coming years.
 Yeah, you have plenty of time to rectify that.
 And you know, the crazy thing is that it's happening in the backdrop of a hostile central
 bank, which has banned centralized exchange fiat relationships to the existing banking
 sector, right?
 Yes, but I find that, I get excited about that because Bitcoin is designed to be money
 that can work in a hostile environment.
 If it cannot work, if your business cannot work in that environment, then it will ultimately
 fail because you're competing against some of the most powerful forces in any industry,
 in any jurisdiction.
 And so you have to be bulletproof.
 The technology needs to be bulletproof, the platform or the blockchain that you rely upon
 needs to be bulletproof, and your business needs to be bulletproof.
 The problem with that is if you are not tested, then you don't build your business in a way
 which is actually bulletproof.
 And now if you go to countries like Nigeria, or if you see organizations like Binance,
 whatever you think about Binance, because pretty much everyone has tried to attack them
 continually, they've got this sort of multi-headed, cut off one head, another two form.
 Where are they based?
 No one knows.
 They're everywhere and nowhere.
 They're the Kaiser Soce of crypto exchanges.
 They have an internal peer to peer network to get fiat into and out of the system.
 So that makes them stronger and ultimately if you cannot stop something, then you have
 to negotiate with it and you've come to some sort of reasonable set of regulation.
 We saw it before with BitTorrent and music.
 There were multiple attempts to stop it.
 They realized it couldn't be stopped.
 So instead of having these box sets of VHS videos, which were like eye-wateringly expensive,
 you would have thousands of videos for a few dollars a month and that was acceptable and
 therefore people paid.
 And that's what we need.
 We need the existence of a truly bulletproof alternative.
 It may not ever be as practical as a centralized alternative, but if it doesn't exist, you're
 in a world of pain.
 Yeah, it's interesting in the case of Nigeria how P2P marketplace usage, whether it's Paxful,
 LocalBitcoins or Binance P2P, which I think is the number one now, has become so incorporated
 into the standard flow in terms of getting access to crypto assets, which in some senses
 inoculates the population against capture because now they have so much experience using
 these tools, which are inherently resistant.
 Whereas in other jurisdictions, you know, centralized exchanges have always existed
 and nobody has that experience.
 Well I would say that Binance, Paxful, LocalBitcoins, BitNob, all these people, they all have those,
 but they're not the number one, two or three decentralized exchanges by far.
 The number one, two or three decentralized exchanges worldwide, and four are WhatsApp,
 Telegram, Signal, WeChat.
 This is where the vast majority of volume goes and it dwarfs the volumes that you see
 on these platforms.
 And that's just informal trades in and out.
 Yeah.
 I mean, so in CoinFloor, because we saw when we started, we were basically the only Bitcoin
 exchange in the UK.
 There was a previous one where the CTO had decided to open source the code, but he included
 open sourcing the passwords to access the servers.
 So they got hacked.
 But other than that, we were the first Bitcoin exchange in the UK.
 And when we started, our main competition was LocalBitcoin.
 Was basically LocalBitcoin in terms of volume.
 We eventually took over because it's just a simpler experience, but we became the number
 one exchange for LocalBitcoin brokers to use to hedge.
 And partly Coinbase tried to enter the market, but they banned LocalBitcoin brokers, which
 gave us the monopoly on this market.
 Fast forward a couple of years.
 We also decided to build our own, based on the feedback from all of these sort of expert
 users of peer-to-peer exchanges, our own peer-to-peer exchange.
 So we had for two or three years a peer-to-peer exchange called CoinFlower Markets.
 And because of internal wranglings around what we would prioritize, do we want to focus
 on consumers or institutions?
 And in the end, institutions run out.
 So we created this physically delivers Bitcoin futures exchange, which was called CoinFlowerX.
 It became CoinFlex, but that's a whole segue, interesting segue.
 But by the end, we're fast approaching becoming the number one peer-to-peer exchange as well.
 And it was very profitable for our users based on our learnings.
 But one thing we learned above all is that brokers go to these platforms, they do one
 or two trades, the good ones, the ones who turn to business, and then get those people
 to come off those platforms and deal with them directly because it's simpler, it's more
 intuitive to the user.
 Most people know how to use a messaging app.
 And they...
 The peer-to-peer brokers.
 The peer-to-peer brokers do.
 So they use these sites as business acquisition.
 And they also means that they don't have to deal with all the competition of people coming
 in, undercutting them, and the user gets a more direct experience.
 So whatever you see on...
 This is one of the big challenges of these peer-to-peer exchanges.
 There's this massive churn where a customer comes on and then immediately goes off after
 two to three transactions.
 So all you're seeing is the tip of new users.
 The vast majority of these...
 years and years going offline. So Peter, the biggest decentralized exchanges in the world
 are WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal.
 So it's like you take an Uber a couple of times and then you just get the Uber driver's
 number and then you use them as a private taxi service.
 Exactly. Although I think there are structural reasons why it might make sense to just because
 what Uber figured out, if you're dealing with normal sort of minicab companies, you'd probably
 do that. But with Uber, because of the convenience of just saying they've turned the drivers
 into commodities.
 Yeah, they made them fungible.
 Because a long time ago, I looked at setting up a competitor to Uber, but it was pre-Coinflow,
 obviously. So we looked into it, but that's the difference. But with this, I don't want
 to make the analogy actually, but you effectively found your dealer, the person who, and once
 you're comfortable with them and you're comfortable with the risk.
 You just stick with them.
 Yeah, because the product is a commodity. It's just the experience. What's important
 to you is the experience, how responsive they are, how polite they are, how consistent they
 are. You don't want to build up that trust each time.
 So I've asked you one question that I wanted to ask you, which is kind of funny. I have
 like 20 written down. We didn't get to Fedimint yet. So tell me a little bit about the history
 of Chowmein Mints. I guess it's right there in the name with David Chowm. But for our
 listeners, just give us a brief introduction.
 I'll do my best. So the idea behind Chowmein Mints was originally put forward in 1983.
 So next year it's going to be 40 years old. So this is not sort of Johnny come lately.
 This is really mature stuff where David Chowmein came up with this idea called blinded signatures.
 And that's at the heart of this idea where you could provide some information. You don't
 know what the information is. Someone can, the recipient can effectively stamp it. And
 so to prove that they've authorized this or they've authorized this information and then
 give it back to you, but without knowing what they stamped, without knowing what they did.
 And you can then receive it. You can then unblind that information and you have that
 information but with proof that some trusted third party has stamped it. So that seems
 pretty cool. But if you have the protocol that was later named the Chowmein e-cash protocol,
 because he came up with this idea for e-cash. Let's take this concept. You're going to a
 fairground or an amusement arcade and inside the amusement arcade there's loads of games,
 but you use tokens to play the games. And what happens is you'll go to the kiosk at
 the front, you give them your cash and they give you these tokens. And imagine they have
 a machine that actually creates, just melts and creates these tokens for you. And you
 take them and play the games. If you find that friends have run out of tokens, you can
 give them some of your tokens. Or you can take some from others. Within the confines
 of this amusement arcade, the person at the front has no idea of who's playing what or
 so on. It's a bearer instrument within as long as people are willing to accept those
 tokens. And those bearer instruments, those IOUs, which you can then take back to the
 kiosk and say, look, I've got these many tokens. I've won some, I borrowed some, I gave some
 away, I've got this much left. And they can give you your cash back. And they put the
 cash into a safe. So that concept is the concept of how the David Chowmein's e-cash system
 works. And it has a couple of parts. It needs to have some sort of safe to hold the actual
 cash. Because in that time, he was thinking about fiat cash because it was the only cash
 you could think about. The person doing all this is effectively a bank or a trusted third
 party. And then the machine to basically print off these tokens and also destroy and shred
 them at the end if they're returned. That's the mint effect because it's minting these
 tokens. Now, when you add blinded signatures, that's the equivalent of putting the shutters
 over the windows of the kiosk. So all that people could do is hand in cash through and
 then they can receive in replacement the tokens or hand in tokens and receive in the placement
 cash. And the third scenario is they can hand in tokens with a note saying, can you give
 me change effectively and receive the change that they had in five, $5, $10 tokens, they
 can receive $51 tokens if they so wish. And so conceptually, the blinded signatures gives
 you the equivalent of putting shutters over the kiosk and everything else is simple programming.
 But you can just theorize that you have in that scenario, theoretically perfect privacy,
 because you don't know how many people are in the place. You don't know. There's no account
 system because each token is a bearer instruments. You don't need accounts. You don't know how
 many people could be the same person each time. It could be different people. And it's
 a bearer. And also people can send them and pass them around to each other without ever
 involving you. So it's a very simple idea that provides theoretically near perfect privacy.
 There are certain edge cases, you could do timing attacks, which you can always do. But
 it's incredibly private using very mature, simple cryptography, which is why I always
 like to describe it as catnip to cryptographers, because for years people wanted to say, look,
 this is an amazing system. And David Chowm actually in 1989, launched a company called
 DigiCash, which used this system. And he, you know, being a technologist, and first
 as technologists do, he ran it for a while, it did quite well, but it didn't ultimately
 didn't succeed and was shut down. Well, it succeeded for nine, eight, nine years, so
 you know, longer than coinflow. So it did okay. But eventually it got shut down for
 various reasons. I think partly the increasing regulatory overhead became more of a challenge,
 especially considering that he originally conceived of eCash as a way to deal with a
 concern he had around increasing, increasing loss of privacy that he was predicting with
 an ever more digital world. And so that that was what was later dubbed Chaumian eCash,
 and sometimes referred to as Chaumian Mint, if you're referring to the minting pod. It
 had two big concerns and flaws. One was that the bank was one single bank, the person behind
 the kiosk, holding the cash and also processing the mint. And even if you could, in theory,
 have multiple banks, ultimately the cash also, you can only have one person holding the cash,
 there was no way to get a $10 note and have five or six people holding a $10 note. So
 even in 2002, and people keep coming back to this idea of Chaumian Mint again and again
 throughout the following four decades. For example, in 2002, there was a proposal put
 forward where they thought that you could have multiple banks working in concert such
 that a majority of them could sign so you could decentralise the bank, but then the
 money would still be split up between the banks because you cannot have multiple banks
 holding the money. And then 2008/2009 came along and Bitcoin came out. And so for the
 first time you could have, or shortly after that, when multi-signals added, pay to script
 hash, you could have multiple people holding money. And that wasn't possible before Bitcoin
 and that was key. So now the money could actually be held with multiple people. So okay, that's
 interesting. So you've got incredible, simple, mature privacy. And you've got the ability
 to have multiple people holding money and money that many people value. And then fast
 forward again, and a few years ago, Blockstream came up with the idea of Liquid and sidechains,
 and they needed a way to hold the Bitcoin on behalf of multiple people in this automated
 version. And they came up with, well, they popularised an idea which they called federations,
 which is a way of effectively taking a process that would normally be implemented and executed
 by one person, but purposefully, whereas normally you want to make things that require multiple
 machines require only one, this way you purposefully split it up across multiple different servers
 and they can interactively work on processing that particular functional service. A similar
 concept is multi-party computation, for example, but it's slightly technically different. Why
 it's technically different, it'd be best to ask Eric Syrian on that, but it's a similar
 concept. Multiple people work on this and it requires, you can choose a quorum of them
 will need to agree before that process continues. And literally after that, within my understanding
 from Eric, within a few months, I believe it was at a hackers Congress from a few years
 ago, a number of prominent or very prominent by their very nature, but very accomplished
 and skilled hackers, white hat hackers and cryptographers came together and just started
 this discussing. I don't know the exact, but I'm going to paint this image in a bar, you
 know, somewhere in Prague or a pub saying, okay, now we've got Chowmein Mint, we've got
 money that can be held by multiple people. And we've got a way to effectively federate
 the bank part, the mint part. Maybe we can make a federated Chowmein Mint using Bitcoin.
 And there were two or three different projects that went off in parallel. We mentioned them
 on the FediMint.org website. One was Skrit and one was FediMint. And Eric Syrian, my
 now co-founder for Fedi was the one who worked on FediMint. And they all started, but Eric
 dug his heels in and kept going on it and kept going on it and didn't stop. Blockstreams
 observed what he was doing and decided, I think it's about two, nearly two years ago
 now to sponsor him because they can see, okay, it's a really novel use of the federation,
 the federation technology using liquid. And, you know, they're also interested in clearly
 in Bitcoin and privacy. So they sponsored it from there and he continued on. And then
 last year in Paralelly Police, Hackers Congress, Prague, I was in the sort of last months of
 selling CoinFlow. I was looking at four ways of getting people off exchanges that, as I
 said, I had some ideas. I had ideas around using Nokia phones because I think still thinking
 of a hardware idea and they pre-existed Bitcoin. They are incredibly cheap. Maybe you can make
 these super cheap and they're everywhere. So you don't have the sort of logistics issues
 because they're already everywhere. Used as doorstops now, but they could be very simple
 hardware wallets and they don't, you can physically disconnect the wifi as well in those other
 devices. He gave me a lot of very polite reasons why it wouldn't work. And I appreciated that.
 And then I asked him about what he was working on. And he explained he's working on this
 thing he'd called FediMint, which is a portmanteau of Federated Charmian Mint. And in his mind,
 it was this really cool privacy technology. But when he was telling me about it, and I
 was starting to question, I realized this was much more than that. This is actually
 a new paradigm in custody. This could become a protocol for custody. We have a protocol
 for the storage of value, which is Bitcoin. We have a protocol for the transfer of value,
 which is Lightning. But what we don't have is a protocol for the custody of Bitcoin.
 And as a result, we either try to store it with a first party, I call it do it yourself
 custody, or I yourselves figure it all out. And that is the best form of custody if you
 can do it. And if you can do it correctly. But it is challenging for various reasons.
 Or we give it all to a third party and leave it for them to sort out, which is third party
 custody. And generally, if you're giving money to a stranger, you need regulation or they
 tend to run off of your money. This is a different option where communities can come together,
 elect by themselves, whatever mechanisms they currently use to make decisions within their
 community, they choose, elect the most trustworthy, honorable people, their knights, their fed
 eye knights, effectively. And those people will work on behalf or will provide a service
 on behalf of the rest of the community to custody their Bitcoin. And that was an interesting
 form. And the more I looked at it, and the more I talked to the people, the more I realized
 it actually solved many problems in the Bitcoin space, in the Lightning scalability space,
 and beyond.
 Wow, that was quite the digest. I like how you lay out the constituent historical pieces
 that came together to make this a reality. I'm just surprised it took so long for the
 Bitcoin community to sort of arrive at this idea.
 Well, it took about three or four months after all the parts were available. And that's what's
 interesting. You couldn't have made it until you had the last point was federations, because
 you had to be able to federate the money that couldn't have happened before Bitcoin. And
 you had to be able to federate the mint as well. And that couldn't have been done before
 either one of the idea of federations, which is does what it needs to do. And it's and
 it therefore is much simpler and a lower risk technical solution. But the other option potentially
 could be something like secure multi-party computation. But out of the two, federations
 is much cleaner, simpler, and therefore it's easier to reason about is a lower risk option
 to go with. And you had support. And so that seems to be again, when you're dealing with
 custody, you want to take the dumbest, simplest approach if you can, that's easiest to reason
 about and has the lowest attack surface. But within that being once that was sort of proposed
 as something in the form of liquid, it only took a few months for three different people
 to decide to work on it. And but then it took time to develop, but they were working, Eric
 was working around the clock, you know, from that point on.
 So when I've heard about this, I think for me, probably, it made me think of microfinance,
 you know, the idea of having community banking, where the community is collectively responsible
 for the individual loans, and they're guaranteed by effectively community collateral, you know,
 if one person defaults, then actually the remainder of the folks in that, you know,
 mortgage are responsible. And so that's the social pressure that causes the defaults to
 be less likely. Was that part of your thinking at all when you're envisioning this?
 No, initially, I was, as I said, I wanted a solution to get people off exchanges. So
 don't think you can have hyper Bitcoinization or a world where potentially everybody's using
 Bitcoin if 90% of people are storing it on a centralized platform. And the centralizing
 forces for a running exchange are immense. So we already see that Binance on many days
 has more trade volume than every other exchange combined. Before that, it was Mt. Gox. This
 is where it will always go to, because liquidity begets liquidity. So we needed an alternative.
 And the trust dynamic of FedEminz was also actually not a bug, but it was a feature because
 it prevents, it acts as this sort of the weak nuclear force versus the strong nuclear force.
 They counteract each other. So that's how I started. However, it wasn't long before
 many people, especially people I talked to in West Africa and the globe itself, pointed
 out the similarities to microfinance and how this could be used. And because of the fact
 that the Federation effectively can run any code in this federated manner. In fact, the
 whole system is built on modules. So one module that the Federation runs is a multi-sig Bitcoin
 wallet, which holds the money. Another module that it runs collaboratively is the interface
 to processing Lightning transactions. Another one is the Chami and Mint. But they're all
 modules already, but anyone can add additional modules. So you could have something which
 could, basically it's a full Turing complete processing server processing environment.
 So you don't have to learn any new fancy code. You just write normal Rust code, create a
 module, implement the right interfaces, and it can do anything you want it to do. So you
 could very easily, anyone who knows how to write Rust could add a module which would
 replicate a feature like that, for example. So if you saw a world where there were hundreds
 of thousands of federations, effectively, if you were going to analogize it to outside
 the Bitcoin space, each federation could be its own blockchain, but without the unnecessary
 overhead of a blockchain. Instead of buggy inter-exchange, inter-blockchain bridges,
 you just use the Lightning network or you sit on the Bitcoin network instead. And then
 got this multi sharded, or you can figure this blockchains or
 layer two, or roll ups, whatever, you have these multi
 sharded environment with hundreds of thousands of shards
 that can join and remove whenever you want. And they all
 can pick and choose the functionality that that makes
 sense for them. And the governance model that makes sense
 for their community. And also, for example, as a user, because
 you have one lingua franca in the form of Bitcoin, you can
 transfer value between them for pennies using the lightning
 network. That is a scalable, that's a scalable, global scale
 infrastructure for for DeFi in my mind.
 Yeah, that's kind of it's a funny, like interesting paradox
 almost to get a socially scalable sort of banking system
 built on top of Bitcoin, you have to take the constituent
 unit down as small as possible. Kind of reminds me of free
 banking, like, the analogy I would draw would be a network of
 independent free banks that are all using Bitcoin standard as
 opposed to the gold standard, which is what they did under
 free banking, each of them issuing notes, based on speci
 gold deposits, with those notes being interoperable, mutually
 accepted between the different banks. And, you know, there
 were periods of time in history when it was those systems were
 totally unregulated, but also totally stable.
 Yeah, I mean, I think that the free banking example has been
 mentioned to be many times. And the other one that I'm constantly
 reminded of, again, is that this apes almost exactly how Finney's
 prediction for the space that will ultimately have these, we
 don't want to call them banks, but the element is conceptually
 similar, settles on the Bitcoin network. And that's the case,
 you settle on the Bitcoin network and use the Lightning
 network for payments, the Bitcoin network is a settlement
 layer. But the people who are doing this set the way this is
 architected, quite interestingly, is that the
 people who are doing the settlement aren't the Fedi
 Mintz themselves or users, but they are a number of Lightning
 service providers, because because a Fedi Mintz can
 connect to a Lightning service provider, without having to
 trust the Lightning service provider, therefore, and
 without having to lock up balance with the Lightning
 service provider, therefore, we can connect to multiple and
 whoever offers the best price, we can we can use a Fedi Mint
 Federation can use. It also means you're more reliable in
 terms of your your experience, because if one Lightning service
 providers channels are, are exhausted, you can instantly
 fail over to someone else because it is you're not
 locking up capital on the Federation side. So therefore,
 you can you have that you can introduce the concept of load
 balancing, which is essential to the modern web to make the
 experience you have getting to sort of five nines uptime you
 have, you can only do that when you can load balance, which is a
 very trivial, which is a conceptually trivial thing to do
 for a Federation.
 So in terms of the practical reality of using a system like
 this, comparing it to first or third party custody, you know,
 how would you say Fedi Mints outperforms, I guess,
 especially relative to just first party DIY custody?
 Well, first of all, from a pure security point of view, if you
 perform first party custody, and you do it correctly, then that
 is the gold standard or the Bitcoin standard, you can't you
 can't get better than that. There is a challenge that most
 people don't do it correctly. And, and, and the hard bit of
 first party custody is not, you know, storing your information
 on a hardware wallet, or so on. The hard bit is how to safely
 deal with the 24 word backup. And if you look at it, I mean,
 the absolute best, if you're just sort of solving for
 security, the absolute best is to never provide never give the
 information about the 24 hours to any second or third party,
 you should not be storing it in a bank vault, because that's a
 third regulated third party, you know, for example, and they
 could technically, or with a or a lawyer, because it's a
 regulated third party, they all if asked by their local
 government to provide information, they will have to,
 you know, bring out the trampoline and start jumping.
 Then also, you would if you want pure first party, you wouldn't
 store it with a second party either. So no storing with your
 wife or children or friends, and so on. Unless they're not aware
 that you're storing with them, of course, then that's not,
 that's not second party custody. That's just you finding a
 hiding place. The other thing that you should do as well, if
 you go through the guides on how to correctly deal with the
 backing up of a 24 words, and this is this is beyond Bitcoin,
 this is for any cryptocurrency, you should you should not store
 it in one place, because you want redundancy, you should store
 it in multiple places. And also, you should not store it where if
 in one place, having the same thing copied to three or four
 places is not is actually worse, because you're now storing the
 whole thing in three places, you what you really want to do is
 you want to break it up into parts, such that any let's say,
 any three or four parts can be used to reconstitute it. Again,
 people make mistakes when they do that as well. They do that in
 a non cryptographically secure manner. So what you really
 should do is set up for example, a multi signature address,
 that's great. Or you use some sort of threshold signature
 scheme, for example, Shamir secret sharing scheme, and break
 it up into parts. If you if you break one key up into parts. If
 you do all of that, and you and you put those play those parts
 into place that no one else knows, then that's, that's good
 quality. First party custody, if you do want to, if you care, if
 you're concerned about things like in the event of your death,
 your your your children getting some of your Bitcoin, you don't
 want to do the greater good through through deflation, then
 you have to tell a third part, a third or second party as well.
 And then by which point your custody is no longer actually
 first party custody, is actually whatever you've done, in terms
 of the backing up of the 24 words. But when you use
 Fedimint, with a click of a button, in terms of the back of
 the 24 words, it can instantly be federated, fresh, encrypted
 into multiple, split into multiple parts, shards using
 Shamir secret sharing scheme, and shared with the guardians
 who are likely to be some of the most trustworthy people within
 your community. Before being shared with them, it's encrypted
 with a secret salt, also known as a pepper. So we can generate
 it for you, because most people are really bad at creating
 passwords, and it's just an unnecessary headache. And then
 we encrypt it with that password and share it with a click of a
 button. And all you need to do is take this password and store
 it in your store it in your email, send it to friends and
 family, because it's much less the security of cameras that is
 far lower than the security requirement for the 24 words.
 Yeah, and and to recover it, if someone were to take that
 password, and send it to the guardians, they would also have
 to convince the guardians who know you that they are you went
 to your so therefore, you only need to secure it away from the
 guardians, but not anyone else. So you can send it to your
 friends in a in a WhatsApp, you can send it to G drive and
 Gmail, versus if it was your password, your sense of Gmail,
 that's a different thing. Because if that's decrypted,
 they have all your money. So but we can do that with one button
 and open up a share dialogue to share, because we have instantly
 available a set of trusted for second parties for you to use to
 store the backup on.
 You mentioned earlier that you'd spent a lot of your time
 talking to regulators. From a regulatory perspective, how do
 you what do you expect the reaction to be to Fediment? Is
 this something that they should be embracing? What do you I
 mean, maybe it'll be case by case, but what do you expect
 there? Hi, it comes to mind, but, but I won't go into but my,
 my view is that we've designed the system from the beginning to
 be a way to help communities custody their Bitcoin safely. It
 does provide privacy. But again, our focus from the privacy point
 of view is to protect members of the community from other members
 of the community, because you don't want your neighbor to know
 how much you're earning. And I think that's, that's recognized
 everywhere that it's not a good idea for your next door neighbor
 or, or friends or family. And sometimes it can put you in
 danger if the people closest to you have awareness of that. So
 financial privacy in that context is, is very important.
 And that's what we focus in from the privacy point of view. But
 beyond that, the system is designed to be aware where my
 period of time as the CEO of coin floor made me aware of the
 different exemptions within the regulatory system, especially in
 the in the in the West. And so we've tried to design it in a
 way to fit within those exemptions. Obviously, people's
 mileage may vary and they should always if they're concerned,
 seek advice locally and regulation is also jurisdiction
 dependent, it's case dependent, there are there are many, many
 variables. So you cannot give a carte blanche answer to that
 question. But one operating a if you're a guardian operating a
 federation, operating a federation, but one of the
 guardians is who's acting as part of a federation, the
 process of operating it is very much an unattended operation. So
 you just like Bitcoin core or some other blockchains, you
 download the software, you click run, and it is it's runs by
 itself. That's, that's often cited as a, as a, an indication
 of this not being a regulated activity. If you're not taking
 any, any sort of action on an ongoing basis to manage it other
 than keeping it fed and watered with electricity and internet.
 Another is that the recommended setup would have no one guardian
 having the ability to take action by themselves. So no one
 has individual agency. So there is no one who has a majority or
 plural of keys. So for example, let's say you had 10 guardians
 and you needed six to sign. That means no one, no two, no three,
 or even four could act together or even five. In fact, in that
 scenario, could act together to form a transaction. So
 definitely not one. And again, if you look at some of the
 guidance from FinCEN, for example, that would be an
 indication, they always say these are indications is case by
 case of being exempt. And then one that I personally strongly
 suggest and recommend is open source of people can obviously
 use do whatever they want, but is to focus on providing it for
 friends, family or people that you've had a pre existing
 evidence of wanting to support and help as opposed to wanting
 to profit from and not seek to make money from it. So just do
 not do not have a profit motive. Again, in many locations, this
 is a very strong exemption and it goes beyond Bitcoin. It's a
 general exemption in all financial services. If it wasn't
 an exemption, then holding money in a piggy bank on behalf of
 your kid would require you to be a regular custodian or going to
 the corner shop, and your friend giving you money to buy
 something would require you to be regulated as a payment
 institute, or even just telling people to buy Bitcoin would
 require you to be regulated as a as a financial advisor. So but
 because you're not looking seeking profit and you're doing
 with you're doing some of the pre existing relationship, it
 would suggest that you're not running it by way of business
 and therefore you would be exempt. Now, if you choose to
 charge money for it, that then you can make some configuration
 changes and do that. But, you know, you will want to get
 advice in your given jurisdiction at that stage. And
 even if you do all of these, you're still if you have a
 concern, you should you should seek advice. But everything
 we're doing having operated a regulated exchange, a regulated
 financial service, I would strongly suggest that if you can
 operate in a manner of seeking advice that doesn't require you
 to be regulated, you would probably want to do that if
 you've never had to operate or run a regulated institution.
 You know, it's funny, as you mentioned earlier in the
 episode that this, you know, you expect that there's a defy
 angle here. And that's maybe part of the longer term play.
 But it occurs to me that this, the default model here is defy.
 I mean, it's a decentralized network of sort of shared
 custodial institutions. So as far as I'm concerned, that's
 defy already.
 Yeah, I mean, Bitcoin is defy, true defy. Lightning is
 decentralizing a payment, we're decentralizing custody. So what
 do what do financial institutions do? So that and
 beyond that, it is also this educational piece, which we have
 three key parts of our strategy. Fedi is, is fedimintis this
 incredible technology, Fedi is free things. I call it code,
 coaching, and collaboration. And so and it's a one third, one
 third, one third. And I think that strategy is probably I
 started fundraising, and from the idea from when I got back
 from Oslo. So I didn't start to the first of June and we raised
 the round by the seventh of June, which happened to be my
 birthday. And that was after raising the target twice. And
 also after a bank holiday weekend with the Queen's, with
 the Queen's birthday during a bank holiday weekend with the
 Queen's 50 years in as in rain. And I think the reason why is it
 wasn't just a tech company, it was it we had this plan for
 rapid global scale. And so code we've got is based on the
 foundations of FediMin, which is incredibly powerful and exciting
 technology, plus a what will be a beautiful human centered
 design using concepts out of IDEO and so on human centered
 design, mobile wallet. It's incredibly simple lightning
 wallet from the user's point of view. But also, coaching. So
 we're going to be educating people, both within the app,
 because I don't think people do enough to educate people within
 the app about not just how to use the app, but what Bitcoin is
 about, and how to manage your money in a way that is safe for
 you. And so we slowly upscale people. And when it makes sense,
 if their balance has got above a certain amount, we will then
 suggest that maybe you should think about going to first party
 custody now because you have an amount that makes sense for
 that. Because we are trying to turn them into better Bitcoiners
 and, and people who are better able to manage their finances,
 decentralize their risk, etc. But also on the ground coaching.
 So especially across the areas in the global Southwest, where
 your money goes further, we will be looking to set up wrap a mass
 education processes. And this is what really prompted it was we
 have the ability to partner with some of the most prolific human
 rights defenders, activists, freedom, NGOs, and so on, which
 you met as well. And we're working with a number of these
 to roll out mass training pro programs, some of them 10s of
 1000s. Some more in one case, we're talking about a program of
 1 million people in one go, but it will take several months to
 prepare for that. But we're able to do these mass rollouts. And
 we have people on the ground who will be educating people. So
 they won't be just given the app and figure it out. They will
 then be shown how to use it how to protect themselves from
 people trying to scam them because these are the much
 bigger concerns than theoretical, technical attack
 vectors, how to then perform use it to more cheaply, more
 effectively perform their day to day tasks that they actually
 care about. So for example, how do I get money from my, my
 friend, friends and family in the diaspora and use the buy
 stuff or pay for rent and so on? We won't just give them the app,
 but we can then show them how to do it in combination with other
 apps. Or how do I increase the quality of my life by earning
 money and find and show them how they can earn money using this
 app, providing service, because we've got this incredible
 technology, by the way, we think it's going to be the next big
 thing we're going to call it work to earn is this amazing
 idea where you work and you earn money for it. So we're going to
 introduce that and show people how they can use the app to do
 that. And then finally, as collaborations, as I hinted, you
 can't do it all from just the app. So we're going to
 collaborate with a lot of people providing services in the
 Bitcoin space, but just make it really easy from the app to just
 you know, just point people towards the services, show
 people how to use them, both within the app and in person on
 the ground, so that they have a full service, you don't have to
 solve it all in one app. But education can bring it all
 together. So yeah, that is a solution is one third, one third
 of my time on those three of our time as a company on those three
 things.
 Well, this is very exciting. It's not every day that an idea
 like this comes along in Bitcoin, but you've always been
 on the vanguard of these new ideas. You know, whether it's
 proof of reserves or not, so very exciting to see from our
 end, looking forward to tracking your progress. I think we'll
 leave it there for now. I look forward to checking back in with
 you. Once this is ubiquitous, especially in emerging markets
 in the global south. But yeah, really, really enjoyed the
 conversation. So thanks for being with us today.
 Thank you very much, matey. I guess, just to say if anybody's
 interested in following this, they should check out
 FediMint.org if you want to hear about FediMint or
 We're Fedi.xyz. Check out either of those. If you want to
 listen to my ramblings, I'm on Twitter as @Obi.
 That's a great handle. I was just marveling at that one.
 Yeah. We'll put the links in the show notes. Obi, thank you.
 I'll see you soon.
 No worries. See ya.
 See ya.
