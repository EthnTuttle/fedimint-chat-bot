 "FedE and FedAment will help put monetary power back into the hands of everyone, everywhere,"
 said FedE Inc. co-founder and CEO Obi Nwosu in a statement.
 This creates brighter futures for billions and especially for those struggling under
 oppressive regimes, which ultimately makes the world a better place.
 The best in Bitcoin made audible.
 I am Guy Swan and this is Bitcoin Audible.
 What is up guys?
 Welcome back to the show.
 This is Bitcoin Audible and I am Guy Swan, the guy who has read more about Bitcoin than
 anybody else you know.
 We've got a great read today.
 This is, I've been reading a bunch about this.
 I've watched like four or five videos.
 I listened to a Marty Bent episode with Obi, Justin Moon, and someone else who was joining
 them from off screen.
 But this is all about FedE, FedE and FedAment.
 FedAment is the protocol.
 FedE is the company.
 So they've just raised a good chunk of change and they actually have a pretty aggressive
 timeline for having a wallet for this.
 This is a really interesting model.
 This is bringing Chomian e-cash, the idea of blind signatures and David Chom's e-cash
 model to Bitcoin, building it on top of Bitcoin.
 And ultimately what is really fascinating about this idea is that it is attempting to
 fix the custody model rather than going from the direction of how do we get everybody to
 you know absolutely hold their own keys and run their own node and you know all this stuff
 which I'll talk about in the guys take.
 Which you know ultimately if we hold that to everyone's standard we end up in a situation
 where 90% of people are just on custodians.
 And that is the problem we have today.
 The question is how do we fix the custodian?
 How do we make it so the custodian isn't centralized?
 How do we make it so that we have privacy from the custodian?
 How can we allow, create a setup that allows us to be a bank, to run our own infrastructure
 and to have our own payment network and to integrate with Lightning and Bitcoin.
 And that is why I think this has really interesting promise because that's the framing by which
 this truly is an innovation.
 And I'm very very interested.
 I want to see what this does.
 So with that let's go ahead and thank our sponsors and we will jump into today's article
 from Bitcoin Magazine.
 So a quick thank you to our amazing sponsors.
 We have SwanBitcoin, the onboarding experience to Bitcoin.
 All the knowledge that you could possibly get the best team.
 The simplest way to set up a Bitcoin savings plan.

 And then if you're stuck having to use fiat I still have to use fiat.
 I do it with Fold.
 I do it with a debit card that gets me sats back on everything.
 I get sats every single time I spend Bitcoin and I'll tell you, I mean excuse me, every
 single time I spend dollars and I'll tell you it makes me feel really good.
 And then lastly CoinKite and the Cold Card Hardware Wallet.
 These guys are the Bitcoin only hardware company.
 They have been around for a long time and they have an awesome device and actually tons
 of great stuff on the store.
 Get yourself a BlockClock mini.
 I haven't done it yet but I got the discount code soon.
 So stay tuned.

 With that let's get into today's read.
 And it's titled "Scaling Bitcoin Custody with Fediment"
 Written by Namcios.
 Fedi raised $4 million to accelerate the development of the Fediment protocol and its
 companion app Fedi, tools that can improve and scale Bitcoin custody.
 Fedi Inc. on Tuesday announced that it had raised $4.2 million in a seed round as the
 company seeks to onboard more users into Bitcoin with the Fedi app, per a statement sent to
 Bitcoin Magazine.
 The application, which the company expects to begin rolling out in Q1 2023, will provide
 a user interface for Fediment, an open-source protocol that leverages federated Chalmion
 eCash mints to decentralize Bitcoin custody and enhance the scaling capabilities of the
 currency.
 "Fedi and Fediment will help put monetary power back into the hands of everyone, everywhere,"
 said Fedi Inc. co-founder and CEO Obi Nwosu in a statement.
 This creates brighter futures for billions and especially for those struggling under
 oppressive regimes, which ultimately makes the world a better place.
 How Fediment Works Fediment is based on the concept of second-party
 custody, which improves upon third-party custody solutions and even some self-custody, first-party
 custody setups.
 Second-party custody involves trusting family members or friends with the custody of one's
 Bitcoin in a way that improves the trust and security models inherent in the classic centralized
 third-party custody solutions, which are often composed of strangers whose incentives don't
 necessarily align with those of the user.
 It isn't uncommon for third-party custodians to fall short in properly securing the Bitcoin
 of a given set of users.
 Not only is this a risk because that third-party represents a single point of failure, but
 the success of this setup is greatly dependent on the incentives that the custodian has in
 securing the user's funds.
 For a stranger, the incentives more closely align with the necessity to either make profits
 from the custody service, blatantly steal, or re-hypothecate the funds than to methodically
 ensure best practices for the safety of those Bitcoin.
 Second-party custody seeks to improve upon this model by having users rely on parties
 they already trust in real life, for example close friends or family members, to secure
 their funds instead of completely outsourcing this task to an institutional stranger.
 With Fediment, users can create a community whose technical leaders will be those tech-savvy
 and trusted enough to ensure a proper functioning of the system.
 Though the concept of trust is alien to most Bitcoin proponents, the reality is some might
 incorporate an aspect of trust in their self-custody setup today without realizing it.
 When users self-custody Bitcoin, they have to make decisions relating to the backup of
 those funds.
 Whereas they can remain in possession of their hardware wallets or signing devices at all
 times, the 12 or 24 words arguably need to be stored away so as to mitigate the risk
 of loss or theft.
 In doing so, users need to opt between storing them in a safe at home, in a friend's safe,
 or in a bank.
 The latter is susceptible to seizure by the government as banks need to abide by eventual
 subpoenas, whereas the former is susceptible to $5 rent attacks.
 Leaving the backup words with a friend can be smart if the friend is highly trustworthy,
 fights against seizure, and not as publicly known to mitigate against indirect $5 rent
 attacks.
 However, it is still a single point of failure.
 Ideally, therefore, the backup codes for a self-custody setup would be split using a
 cryptographically secure model such as Shamir's secret sharing and each part given a trusted
 second party.
 The issue with this, besides the technical complexity of devising such a scheme, is again,
 trust.
 The user needs to trust not only each second party, but collectively that they don't
 collude against the user and steal their Bitcoin.
 Therefore, even the most sophisticated of the self-custody setups might include some
 level of trust.
 FedAment brings that trust assumption, second party trust, into a model that is less technically
 complex than self-custody and more scalable and private.
 Here's how it works.
 Chameon E-cash As mentioned above, FedAment is based on
 federated Chameon E-cash.
 Chameon E-cash is the digital cash invented by Dr. David Chalm, an early cryptographer
 who in the 1980s sought to mitigate against the privacy issues inherent in the digitization
 of money.
 A trend the researcher foresaw as digital means of communication began to emerge in
 his time.
 Chalm was concerned with the impending privacy risks of a digitized money, where banks would
 be able to trace people's spending, and physical cash's peer-to-peer nature would
 be lost.
 The issuance and redemption of Chalm's digital cash was still centralized, though its transacting
 was peer-to-peer.
 The researcher didn't attempt to break free from government money per se, rather he sought
 a means to conduct in-person cash trades online.
 Chalm's money leveraged cryptography to allow a user to deposit money into a bank
 and receive an IOU banknote that could be traded further among other people.
 That banknote promised its holder X amount of money to be redeemed by the bank at any
 given time, a concept popularized by the banknotes of the time of the gold standard.
 Given the not-so-great divisibility and transportability of gold, gold IOU banknotes allowed for an
 easier transfer and carrying of "gold."
 Likewise, a holder of Chalmian e-cash would be able to redeem it for money at the bank
 that issued it.
 Chalm's model, of course, relied on the reputation of the bank.
 Customers transacting with that bank's IOU note would need to trust the bank's ability
 to honor the contract stipulated by that note.
 Otherwise, customers would see no value in them and hence would forego transacting in
 those notes completely.
 On the privacy side of things, Chalm's e-cash leveraged blind signatures, a cryptographic
 trick that prevents the bank from knowing who owned the banknote.
 Without it, it would be trivial to link a user's identity with a given note.
 The example given by Chalm himself to illustrate this concept relied on carbon copy paper envelopes.
 The user can obtain a blind signature, a signature on something which the signer doesn't know
 the content of, by putting the data they want signed inside the envelope made of carbon
 copy paper and sealing it.
 The signer could sign the envelope itself and due to the carbon copy paper, the signature
 would "leak" to the data and sign it as well.
 With Chalm's blind signature protocol, the depositor would send a blinded piece of data
 to the bank.
 After receiving the data blindly signed, the depositor would be able to unblind it, which
 would allow them to transfer it by giving it to another person.
 After a given amount of trades, that note could at any time be redeemed back at the
 bank for its corresponding amount of money.
 At the time of redemption, the bank would be able to check whether it had previously
 signed that piece of data and whether it had been already redeemed or not, checking for
 validity and shielding against a double spend.
 A federation improves upon the centralization of Chalmian eCash.
 It is what allows the decentralization of custody and hence also improves upon the more
 popular third-party custody solutions in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
 A federation is a technical setup formed among multiple parties with a multi-signature Bitcoin
 address.
 A multi-signature, multi-sig for short, enables funds to be locked up in a Bitcoin address
 that requires a minimum amount of those parties to agree before moving any funds.
 In practice, this works by requiring multiple signatures, hence the name, so the funds can
 be unlocked and moved.
 Common multi-sig setups include 2 of 3 and 3 of 5.
 In the former, 3 signatures comprise the setup in total and 2 are needed to move the Bitcoin,
 whereas in the latter, 3 signatures out of the total of 5 are needed before the BTC can
 be spent.
 The multi-signature ensures that one custodian doesn't go rogue and spends the Bitcoin
 it is custodying on behalf of the user.
 The user still needs to trust the custodians collectively, but the resilience of the system
 is increased as multiple people the user supposedly trusts in real life would need to collude
 against the user to steal their funds.
 This is why the usage of known and trusted parties to make up the federation is a must.
 Moreover, the multi-sig also ensures that the IOUs issued by the federation are also
 a multi-sig, requiring the same quorum for the movement of funds and meaning that one
 guardian can't create IOUs by themselves.
 The answer to scaling private Bitcoin custody
 Putting it all together, Fedament leverages a decentralized trust system to enable Bitcoin
 users to form communities with friends and family, within which money transactions are
 cheap, quick, and anonymous, and custody is simplified and strengthened.
 Users can join a Fedament community by depositing Bitcoin to the federation and receiving the
 corresponding amount of IOU tokens, which can be transferred anonymously to members
 of that community.
 The receiving party then exchanges the received tokens for new ones, a process that is similar
 to Chon's blind signature scheme enables the federation to check that the sender did
 not double spend those tokens.
 After a successful exchange for new tokens, the receiver marks the transaction as complete.
 The Lightning Network, Bitcoin's second-layer protocol for fast and cheap payments, can
 enter the Fedament mix to further strengthen the setup.
 More specifically, Lightning allows users in a federation to be interoperable with the
 entire Bitcoin ecosystem.
 In a nutshell, Fedament wallets have the potential to bring strong privacy to Bitcoin users with
 better security than third-party custody setups and more ease of use than fully-fledged self-custody
 solutions.
 It might be the tool that answers the challenge of scaling self-custody while encouraging
 more people to forego outsourcing the custody of their Bitcoin to a centralized custodian
 who is effectively a single point of failure.
 One of the many possible solutions for a feasible hyper-Bitcoinized world.
 Alright, that wraps up our piece on Fedament.
 Let's take a break really quick and hit our sponsor and then we will jump back in.
 Fold card sats back on freakin' everything.
 Guys, I know you've heard this probably a hundred times.
 times but if you are doing fiat with a normal boring ass bank account and
 getting credit card points whatever the hell that is or airline miles or
 actually you don't nobody gets rewards on debit cards so with your with your
 debit card on hey buddy hey buddy debit card on your bank you're not getting
 you're not getting anything back for that it's a debit card but you can
 with fold I do all of my normal person I went out went out today to get some
 coffee I got 2% back I got 2% back on coffee in sats and with with the price
 the way it is I have been stacking like mad so just literally feels like just
 like a week or two ago I was at 9 million I'm on my way to 10 million
 sats already and if you have the fold card you can even get your own personal
 node from like start 9 or crypto cloaks you get your you know deck your node out
 with a 3d printed case and they have like 7% back in sats you can get 5% back
 on Amazon if you have the premium card guys for everything that you still have
 to do in your fiat life with shitty fiat get sats back with it and you get 20%
 off with code Bitcoin audible 20% off the price of the premium card you get
 it you get daily sat spins you get the little metaverse game thing which is
 just a fun way to give you free sats and free spins and you'll go through your
 day with that warm fuzzy feeling knowing that even having to spend fiat and not
 being able to buy Bitcoin with it when you have to spend fiat on your life and
 you have to like consume stuff for no good reason just because you have to eat
 and stay alive yeah I know it sucks but you're getting sats you're getting sats
 for every bit of it go to guyswan.com/fold and use code Bitcoin audible
 all one word for 20% off let's get back into the show
 all right so a fed a mint this this is a really really interesting technology
 there's something you know e cash and blind signatures were kind of the they
 were they were such a major part of the entire cypherpunk ethos of the entire
 cypherpunk movement because they were kind of the key before it was realized
 that the centralized nature of the protocol or of the money itself was
 going to be critical to actually achieving any degree of privacy to
 achieving any of the secondary goals well excuse me really the cypherpunk
 primary goal was privacy and autonomy but that you can't do that being a
 derivative of a centralized system if somebody else controls the money
 somebody else ultimately controls the server that you have to redeem from or
 the gold the actual gold ounces that you have to redeem your paper for then it
 doesn't matter what properties your paper has and I think that's that was
 kind of the fundamental realization because charms model David charms blind
 signatures and the e cash model was actually brilliant the problem was is
 that you had to have banks implement it but it was a way to exchange bank
 deposits between people without using the bank as the payment processor so
 that is the interesting takeaway is that your the bank is able to sign off on a
 transaction without knowing anything about the transaction so that rather
 than requiring them to vet everything the the quote-unquote the e cash itself
 is its own vetting and they simply sign to to recognize its transfer without
 knowing who or from who or to who the transfer is occurring so that you can so
 that the redemption is private the movement of the funds are private I mean
 it's it is literally e cash that is the best way to think of it it's the same
 thing that cash is cash you eventually go back to a bank like think about in
 the context of like gold back to dollars you can transfer the cash you can do it
 privately it is it is yours it's a quote-unquote bearer instrument and then
 you go to the bank you go to the institution to redeem that cash for the
 the underlying monetary good and that was the e cash idea and it was brilliant
 it was great but it required adoption it required the centralized systems the
 the actual infrastructure of the banking system to be okay with it and that's
 what ended up not happening granted there's a lot of if you actually dig
 into the history chum was not a businessman and you know there were a
 lot of just bad decisions made and so like I think it was it was destined to
 fail one way or the other as the way the way the model was like I think like I
 said just a minute ago is that the ultimate problem was that you had to
 remove the centralized nature of what you were redeeming but uh nonetheless I
 think just as a business model it probably just wasn't gonna work even if
 even if it hadn't been that digi cash the company I think digi cash was the
 name of the company was uh it seems like it was poorly run if you dig into the
 history of it but nonetheless back to fedimint so this is and this whole this
 whole thing is very much aligned with an idea I've talked about a lot is
 hyperlocalization and this is this is very common in Bitcoin you know Marty
 Bent had a great episode with crap they did this on TFTC I can't remember the
 guy who wrote the book about like the hyper localization of America and kind
 of like laid out this potential future path to look more localized communities
 but this is like such a great example and that's also why okay let's go back
 to the original complaints about fedimint because I think the framing of
 what we are comparing this to is the important thing is the important way to
 think about this is you know a a lot of the complaints and 100% valid the fact
 that it is an IOU it is 100% an IOU so the Federation I mean it's trust
 minimized not really the word it's it's trust lowered it's a trust lowered
 relationship but really it is a find someone you can trust relationship it's
 putting you in the driver's seat as far as who you trust and your relationship
 with them and allowing it to localize it's so hard with the models that we
 have today in the in the business world and in the payment processors and
 finance you can't do that I can't like go to my brother or my best friend and
 get together and make a bank and then you know the hilarity of that is just
 absurd but the idea that we could actually do this with Bitcoin having an
 open source protocol that we can build on top of and all we have to do is run a
 computer all we have to do is run a setup that actually just stays online
 it's basically just running a home server and I can still do my job my
 brother my friend like our community and our family can still continue to do what
 it is that we do and run this system the system has been automated for us that
 truly changes the relationship between you and the quote-unquote payment
 processor the Fedament the the Federation but understand we should not
 be comparing this to an OB Nuosu he talks about this in his in the Bitcoin
 2022 talk that he gave on the open source stage and this was really good is
 that this is a this is a form of custody this is an alternative to the current
 forms of custody so when people are talking about this like oh it's an IOU
 oh it's you know you know not your keys not your coins situation like that is
 perfectly understandable but what you're comparing it to is everybody holding
 their own keys does everybody have a cold card and a bit box and a you know
 multi their own little private multi sig does everybody run their own lightning
 node and have their own position in and run their own full Bitcoin node so that
 they're verifying and confirming all these transactions themselves it's not a
 comparison to that those people are running that in fact those people are
 the ones that will likely be running the Fedament because they're the ones that
 are that everybody else in their community is having to lean on I'm a
 perfect example of this I love the idea of the Uncle Jim model because what's
 brilliant about Bitcoin is that we can localize in a small trusted group we can
 build strong trusted relationships and provide a monetary and financial
 services to each other we're going back to the days of like the late 1800s with
 fraternities and local trusts and these sorts of things I think this is the
 future and the reason I think it's the future and OB talks about this too
 because when he goes to reaching people like everybody talks about like the
 global South we're talking about like Africa and basically the developing
 world is really kind of the focus here they already have these strong trusted
 local communities they have to they have to because they don't have the
 infrastructure this will not be a great well it probably could be a great tool
 but I don't think this will this trust model will make the most sense for
 people in the US we are far more and most of the modern world honestly we're
 far more accustomed to just handing off our trust to some giant corporation
 giving them all of our information and we don't know shit about our neighbors
 we don't know anything about the people in our neighborhood in our local
 community that sense of community has really fallen apart but I think it's
 coming back I think it's going to be a really critical part of the future for a
 number of different reasons and one just a very simple one that I think I
 want to touch on and let you think about is the fact that go to the Dali to go to
 mid journey these artificial intelligences that you can just make an
 image from a description these things are able to recreate your likeness in a
 completely unique situation that you can just dream up they they modify they take
 and learn from all of the images the images of the internet all the images of
 you and they are able to create a fake situation on take a likeness of you and
 recreate a completely made up completely invented people on completely invented
 situations completely invented details and even quote-unquote imagine things
 now when a artificial intelligence just a just artificially intelligent
 algorithm that just you know contextualizes an image when you can
 tell it to draw a picture of a plane you know flying through the air with frogs
 stuck to it and it can do that that is also an algorithm that will easily turn
 around and identify a plane when signing up for when running a capture to sign up
 for a website it will get to a point and I think this will happen very very
 quickly where our our fail-safes to make sure that we're dealing with humans
 online won't work anymore that there will just be too many things that a
 specialized computer can do to fake being human and that the and our
 personal information will be unsafe as well it will not be oh give me your home
 address no that stuff is already screwed I think I think on a long enough
 timeline even that stuff falls apart and you're also looking at a time where an
 artificially intelligent an algorithm is when we can already put makeup on our
 face and like an Instagram filter that you can have stars or birds flying
 around above our head or we can take a picture and see what we look like when
 we're you know 50 years older it's not gonna be it's not gonna be long before
 a another person can have a conversation as you over zoom to someone else with
 your voice and your face the solution to that is localization is in the real
 world now there will still be times where we actually interact with
 computers we interact with big corporations but I think we will we will
 treat them it will be in situations where we do not need to trust and a
 trustless money will be exactly how we interact with those things where it
 doesn't even matter if it's a bot it doesn't even matter if it's just a
 protocol fulfilling our order on you know the Amazon network that isn't even
 run by people anymore but when when we're kind of in that surreal
 relationship with institutions that produce or protocols that produce or
 connect producers and consumers the areas that do need trust will be will be
 hyper localized the ability to actually verify will have to happen verify who we
 are as a person when our money simply isn't good enough when there is some
 sort of trusted relationship we'll have to go back to local we'll have to go
 back to a place where you can go meet your friend in person because that is
 the one thing that can't be faked and that's also why I think Africa why I
 think a lot of the global South why a lot of the developing world might
 actually end up ahead of the modern world because they don't have to rebuild
 those relationships they are already having to depend on them because their
 institutions fail them constantly their governments are unbelievably corrupt
 they don't they don't have this oh I'm just going to blindly accept that this
 institution is telling me the truth they have to rely on their local communities
 they're already doing it with cell phones and their local networks this
 sort of model a federated custody model for these these groups for these
 communities this is where it is going to serve the greatest good. Fediment is
 something that you compare to custody solutions not something that you compare
 to cold storage multi-sig run your own node it doesn't compare to that what it
 does is it creates a way to have small community led custody solutions where
 all of the members in that community can maintain privacy from the people
 offering the service and you can you can have the service fault tolerant that is
 a big deal and it's also it's also I think a huge way in which this will be a
 brilliant way to get around regulations
 because none of the actual participants are custodians per se.
 Not any single one of them is.
 They are as a group, but they're not an entity.
 They're just sharing an address together.
 I think that's going to massively benefit how we can actually set these things up.
 And this is what this could get us closer to that future where,
 you know, just like a router in your home,
 you know, we don't have enough IP addresses for all the devices in the world.
 Not even close.
 In fact, we crossed that, you know, it's like,
 I don't even know how many years ago, like 15 years ago, 20 years ago or whatever.
 We just blasted past that and now the number of devices versus the number of IP addresses
 are absolutely retarded.
 It doesn't even compare. It's almost comical.
 But how do we do it?
 Local networks.
 Local networks on top of local networks on top of the wide area network.
 Every IP address has 15 devices behind it.
 30 devices behind it.
 And this is how I see Bitcoin scaling from in a context of UTXOs,
 in a context of addresses.
 Shared custody.
 This allows us to build up trusted relationships again
 by having a foundation to lean on that is trust less, that is trust minimized.
 I've said this before on the show,
 but it's probably a long time since I've really talked about it specifically.
 I think the truly revolutionary models and the truly transformative economic relationships,
 the business relationships and the systems and the companies,
 quote unquote, which it might even be finicky to call them companies,
 but the things that are truly going to be transformative
 and how the economy works and how we relate to each other in the Bitcoin space,
 in a Bitcoin world are going to be based around models of trust.
 This is why I think synonym is one of the most important things here.
 You know, synonym is not to get on a completely different thing,
 but the idea of a web of trust of the slash tags of having an identity
 and degrees of trust with the people around you
 and being able to access or filter information based on the trust that you have with the people around you.
 I think that's going to be as critical and as breakthrough in the idea,
 like that is where I think true innovation is going to happen in this space
 because it's much like, you know, just being able to write reviews on a website.
 Like, you know, Amazon people don't think about this,
 but when the when Amazon was coming up when the internet was being born
 and we were figuring out these tools some of the most absolutely remarkable groundbreaking
 changed everything about how we interacted with the internet
 and changed everything about every single website
 and a model of doing something on the internet was like leaving reviews.
 It was like having a rating from everybody who's purchased the item.
 Retweeting the like button the like button and the share button were they were the things that allowed
 they created the idea of virality.
 They created the viral movement something as simple as that had to be invented.
 It wasn't immediately obvious and when what these tools were were they tool they were tools of communication.
 They were tools of how to essentially gamify social signaling, right?
 They were how do we lean on the crowd for information
 and things that are interesting and for the spread and the creation of content.
 Like one of the one of the other great breakthroughs of the internet was letting your users create your content.
 Facebook doesn't make any content.
 Twitter doesn't make any content.
 We make the content for them.
 Wikipedia is is a freaking encyclopedia.
 It's the greatest encyclopedia that has ever been created.
 It is more accurate than the centralized company encyclopedias
 and has been for a long time.
 It is better sourced and it is entirely created by just the crowd.
 In that context Bitcoin just just like the internet was a system of communication.
 Bitcoin is a system of trust.
 It allows it allows creating trusted relationships around a monetary base that a totem that can be trusted
 because you can fully verify it.
 It is the foundation upon which we can build trusted relationships and business relationships again
 because our institutions in this day and age our modern institutions have utterly failed us.
 They have collapsed.
 They have abused our trust.
 They have corrupted it and we are going to have to localize to find our solutions again
 and that is in building our own versions of these systems
 and the ability to have an on-the-fly like spin it up in a few minutes sort of side chain
 that is that is a custody model that allows us to create a community wallet.
 Like this is the Bitcoin Beach.
 This feels like to me what this could be.
 I'll make sure we caveat it that way.
 What this could be is a better more aligned Bitcoin Beach setup is the relationship between
 it's multi-sig made better because it's multi-sig with privacy added
 and a simple way to do off-chain payments off-chain transfers of Bitcoin
 and relying on a quote-unquote fault tolerant group of guardians
 and the simple fact of the matter the simple and great benefit is that it is private
 and it is a far far better relationship than what everybody has with Coinbase
 and inevitably if we do not and this is why I really appreciate Obie's.
 He refers to this as the third pillar that this is like second-party custody.
 I like that idea the second-party custody.
 That's a really good framing.
 I guess you can say but really what I think this is is trying to solve the the centralized ease
 of onboarding of using and of just having everything work of a centralized custodial model
 of using of simply using Coinbase.
 How do you get that but step that one step two steps three steps closer to the hold your own keys
 the the I am in my multi-sig I am running my lightning node Etc.
 Etc. How do we move the custodial relationship further in that direction?
 How do we obsolete the stupid entirely dependent the entirely not fault-tolerant centralized
 one hacker can come in and take everybody's funds on Coinbase model.
 How do we obsolete that because if I if I think that if we don't do that
 if we don't find a way to improve that which is why I think fedimint is actually a huge huge net positive
 is that we just still end up with 80% of people entirely custodial
 who never hold their own keys and never even get a touch of it.
 And this is this is an interesting middle of the road.
 This is an interesting trade-off to walk us in the direction of walk us into into the direction of self-custody
 of people using Bitcoin with more autonomy and more individual control and always always more privacy.
 And for all of its trade-offs for all of its negatives because it is a custody solution.
 I think any and every mechanism we can develop for better privacy on Bitcoin is a huge win.
 And this is also one of those things that allows the tech savvy the the quarter the ones that are most likely
 to run a Federation to basically run this system for a community is that when you can plug this thing into lightning
 so that this wallet can literally just fulfill any Bitcoin, fedimint or lightning invoice
 that it just works seamlessly between all of these.
 But it's also the kind of thing that would justify that would make you know,
 $50 on-chain fees to make changes to the Federation justifiable not a problem.
 And the the need or the desire to get privacy and to compress those transactions by coin joining them
 or aggregating signatures with other Federations that you work with which actually doesn't really matter
 because you don't have to trust another Federation if you're not accepting their IOUs.
 All you're doing is using them to offload your signature data by combining signatures.
 Well, then they become a great means of privacy and you break on-chain analytics almost entirely.
 Now, obviously that's in a perfect world where everybody is, you know, using this in combination with lightning
 and it's also one of the beautiful things about lightning, you know, people read a bunch of comments
 and like a bunch of crypto people talking about how lightning adoption isn't as big as everybody thought it was going to be.
 Well, it's one of those things that lightning is so powerful explicitly because it's a branch between,
 it's chain agnostic, it's like you can run it, you can connect it to Fediment, you can connect it to Liquid,
 you can connect it to these alternative systems to the shadow chains and the state chains of the setup.
 So as soon as if any of these things catch on, lightning becomes the bridge back to Bitcoin.
 Lightning becomes the communicator, becomes the translator from one to the other.
 And then when, with the fact that with Fediment, with a system like this, you can actually, it's pretty much
 agnostic to the code that you run on it.
 So I think there was another one that was mentioned here, or was this in another piece that, this was in another piece that I read.
 But the idea that you can run simplicity on this, they actually did a hackathon and put simplicity on a Fediment chain,
 which is a completely different scripting system that's not on Bitcoin and would require a massive amount of work
 and would be a huge thing to actually have this available on Bitcoin, but you can just run it on something like Fediment.
 So you have the optionality to have both this ability to privately transact off-chain in the Fediment
 that you can interact by having a lightning connection and you can interact with any lightning invoice
 and send Bitcoin or lightning to anybody, anywhere.
 So the Fediment isn't locked, it's not isolated.
 But at the exact same time within the Fediment, within this little "sidechain", you can have smart contracts,
 you can have simplicity, you can have a completely different scripting language.
 It's basically agnostic. You can essentially do whatever the hell you want in it.
 And ultimately at the end of the day, you're leaning on the fact that you have a federated fault tolerance to keep the thing from failing,
 keep it very unlikely to be co-opted, very unlikely to ultimately fail or to lose a critical number of keys.
 And it remains robust and even the peg in and the peg out to enter and leave the federation,
 all users have privacy within the entire process.
 So, I don't know, I'm not even sure if I hit all the points that I wanted to get into, but this is interesting.
 This is interesting. That is probably the simplest way to put this, is I see this as a very, very exciting development
 that I think a lot of communities that are not thought about as customers,
 like in the context of the Western world and the modern world and the United States,
 this doesn't seem like, "Oh, this is like, oh, not a very interesting model."
 But from the context of a small village, a community in the developing world that has no institutions that it can trust,
 has no good banking infrastructure and has an unbelievably corrupt government,
 but everybody has a freaking smartphone, this is a really big deal.
 This is a really big deal and I think that is the more interesting model and the more sustainable path
 to long-term robust adoption and the fact that this could help scaling in a massive way.
 It's just, it's a really, really, really interesting.
 So, with that, we'll be talking about this again, no doubt.
 This was just a really cool introduction and it's really exciting to see Justin Moon and Obi and,
 oh God, I can't remember who else is working on this.
 It's really good to see that crew building something like this.
 This is cool and it's also, man, to see Xiaomi and eCash actually happen
 because we can build it on top of Bitcoin after all this time.
 That's just exciting. I don't know. I don't know. There's something about bringing back a little bit of Cypherpunk history.
 It's amazing how many tools and ideas were, you know, attempted to be put into place that were so promising
 all throughout the 90s that the Cypherpunks designed on and built,
 but did not have an independent trustless base to build it off of and because of that failed.
 There might kind of be, there might be some really interesting,
 there might still be a lot of things that the Cypherpunks created that are left to unpack.
 Things finally to be realized 20, 30 years later because we have Bitcoin.
 So, I'll leave it there. Thank you guys for listening.
 I am Guy Swan. A huge thank you to the Audio Knots for supporting this show,
 to Swan Bitcoin, to Fold and to CoinKite who make this show possible
 and keep the lights on around here and keep rad, fed, and warm.
 Hey, buddy. Are you getting fussy? Daddy's ranting too long.
 All right, guys. I am out. Thank you so much for listening.
 I'll catch you on the next one. And until then, take it easy!
