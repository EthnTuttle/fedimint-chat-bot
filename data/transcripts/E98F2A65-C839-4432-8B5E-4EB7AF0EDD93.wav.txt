 Most of the solutions that I've seen around custody take us from A to B to C so that better
 custody they improve upon where we are.
 What we did is look at what does the world look like when everybody's using Bitcoin,
 when there are billions of people using Bitcoin.
 Hello there, how are you all?
 Welcome to the What Bitcoin Did podcast, which is brought to you by Gemini, the only place
 I'm using to find Bitcoin.
 I'm your host Peter McCormack and today I've got an awesome interview with Obi Nwosu, the
 co-founder of FediMint and board member for Jack Dorsey and Jay-Z's B-Trust organization.
 Now I first met Obi a couple of years ago when he was the CEO of the UK exchange Coinfloor,
 but that seems like a liFedime ago now because since then he left Coinfloor and co-founded
 one of the most talked about projects in Bitcoin.
 Anita Posh first made me aware of FediMint when I spoke to her in November last year
 and Matt O'Dell has talked to me a lot about the privacy implications so I knew I had to
 ask Obi to come on the show and give me an explainer.
 So I hope you enjoy this.
 If you've got any questions about this or anything else then feel free to drop me an
 email on hello@whatbitcoindid.com.
 Why is it?
 We always have shit.
 We had 60 people at the meetup, the first one in Bedford.
 60 people?
 At the meetup.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 BTC Gandalf was there I think.
 He was there, yeah.
 He came and he drove down the night.
 He was like, "I'm thinking of coming."
 I was like, "What, from Scotland?"
 He's like, "Yeah, I might just drive down."
 He did.
 My God.
 Like this.
 So we just signed this lad two minutes into his league debut for us.
 He's just arrived.
 Oh, MG.
 It was a bit jumpy that.
 That's how to arrive.
 We had nearly 300 people there.
 Last year we were getting like 40.
 And who was the other team you were playing against?
 Rushton and Higum.
 They were like a couple of places below us last season, but we're so much stronger now.
 I mean, that guy there, Dan Walker, we signed for Bedstown.
 They won step four last year.
 So he's a proper good player.
 I mean, they hit the bar, but I mean, we could have-
 It was comfortable, wasn't it?
 Yeah, we could have six or seven.
 And what's the plan in terms of getting to Premier?
 I think people take that too serious.
 The plans to get into the league, football league.
 That's the plan.
 And it's based on two things.
 You got to get a crowd down.
 Either my Bitcoin needs to massively increase in value, or I need to keep convincing Bitcoin
 companies to sponsor it.
 But I think momentum is everything.
 I think if we're crushing it, we should win the league.
 We're the best team.
 If we're top of the league by February next year, I can go back to all the sponsors and
 say, "We delivered."
 Okay.
 But you need sponsorship to go into the league.
 You can't just at the top, you automatically go in.
 Look, so we're a nothing club.
 The only people who would come last season would be people who had family, like their
 family played for the team.
 And now we're building a community.
 But 300 people come into a game will make you maybe 2,000 pounds or two home games a
 month, 4,000.
 You say half of that for running the club, that gives you 500 quid a week wages.
 It's hard to compete on that.
 We've got the best budget, which is 1,500 pound a week wages.
 But the only reason we can pay that is I've got good sponsors.
 On top of that, we put in a new irrigation system, 20 grand.
 We've taken on a ladies team.
 We've bought them all new equipment, merch, everything.
 Sorry, tracksuits and kit.
 We spent 20 grand on that.
 We've taken on a youth team, we spent 10 grand on their stuff.
 So like all the money the sponsors have invested is essentially us like a startup just out
 of the gate running, taking on the biggest women's team locally, taking on the youth
 team, sorting out our grounds, sorting out our signage, sorting out our merch, getting
 our website sorted, having a videographer to do it.
 It is basically like setting up a company.
 Totally.
 But the difference with this, it will never scale to the point of exponential growth in
 terms of revenue.
 What it most likely does is get to the point where it's sustainable.
 So if we can get into the town center and play our games at the rugby club, our crowd
 will probably go from 300 to maybe 800, 900.
 And then at this level, our income would allow us to have the best budget in the league.
 And you've got to keep growing that through the leagues.
 I think we'll always need like sponsors or people like Cameron, Tyler, Winklevoss, to
 make us do it.
 But we do have a Bitcoin meetup which has 60 people come to it.
 We're about to teach all the players about Bitcoin.
 We're going to put QR codes on their social media cards.
 If they score a goal, it goes up and they get tips.
 There's a buzz around this town.
 And in some ways, this could become like an El Zonte kind of thing.
 In that we create this kind of sporting local community that's all around Bitcoin.
 And it just spreads the knowledge.
 But it only works with sponsors.
 No, we can only launch with sponsors.
 Give us five years, we might become sustainable because we have a buzz and a crowd in the
 town.
 And people come for it.
 But we've spent like 200,000 preseason on getting everything ready.
 Like our streaming, it costs us 60 grand a year to stream all the games.
 60 grand?
 It's about 1500 pound a game because you have a commentator, four cameras, three cameras,
 instant replays, all that kind of stuff to do it right.
 But because of that, we have a few hundred tuning into each game, which hopefully become
 a thousand.
 They'll also buy merch, right?
 But clubs at our level cannot do this.
 We operate, honestly, I think the standards of what we're trying to do on a lot of the
 levels are crap Premier League, good championship in that we do a printed program that's nice.
 Our website is bollocks.
 We're trying to do everything top level.
 But we can only do it because we've got the money.
 Yeah, but I think if you, with everything, if you start with passion, if you're really
 passionate about what you do, then you can figure everything else out.
 Yeah.
 And we're doing good stuff.
 I mean, yeah, the other big local team, they gave up the ladies team.
 They kind of just didn't look after them.
 We're like, well, that's ridiculous.
 Like you've got to have ladies football as part of this.
 So we've taken them on and the game.
 What would you say the mix is women to men on Saturday?
 It was higher than I thought.
 I reckon it was like, I don't know, 60, 40 men.
 Yeah.
 60, 40.
 You know, 60, 40 men, 60 men, 40% women.
 Yeah.
 And girls.
 That's pretty good.
 Yeah.
 And it was like a family event, wasn't it?
 Yeah.
 And if you think the girls just won the Euros, you know, it's a good time.
 So anyway, the plan is in the Premier League, the plan is football league, six promotions.
 Step by step.
 Step by step.
 Hopefully in six seasons.
 Anyway, man, how are you?
 I'm really good.
 I was enjoying walking along the river in Bedford.
 It's beautiful.
 It's very relaxing with the swans and everything.
 It was nice.
 Yeah.
 Bedford's actually...
 Thank you for the recommendation on where to stay.
 The Embankment.
 Yeah.
 It's the best pub in town.
 I've got to get Danny up there at some point.
 But no, it's a really nice part of the town.
 I love it.
 I love my hometown.
 I could tell.
 You're really passionate about it.
 Bedford Maximalist.
 So last time we spoke was a while back.
 You were at CoinFloor.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 That feels...
 It was only...
 It was less than two years ago, but it feels like a liFedime ago.
 Now you're running the hottest startup in Bitcoin.
 Everyone's talking about it.
 We had an incredible launch and we're really humbled by the reception.
 But yeah, it's so amazing.
 The people I work with just love it every day.
 How did that transition from CoinFloor to this happen?
 So CoinFloor, the last couple of years, I became aware of the fact that I wanted to
 do something else.
 CoinFloor was great.
 It was a great experience.
 And we had a number of firsts, but it was very focused on the UK.
 And right from the beginning, I'd been very interested and passionate about bringing Bitcoin
 to the world, starting with the global south.
 And with traditional finance, VCs and investors, the idea of your second market being Nigeria
 or Venezuela was just not going to happen.
 Also at the same time in 2019, the Financial Action Task Force approved the travel rule.
 And from being this one of the first regulated exchanges in Gibraltar and Europe, for me,
 it was very clear that over the following three to six years, we were going to see the
 situation for people being able to take their Bitcoin off exchanges get more and more difficult.
 So I decided at that point that I wanted to find ways of getting people off exchanges
 because at that stage, already 90 to 95% of our users would keep their money on exchanges,
 even though we were trying to get it off, almost begging them to take it off.
 And that situation was getting worse as regulation became worse.
 And at the same time, I started also looking at ways to find people to purchase CoinFloor,
 who had the same philosophical leanings as I did.
 And that's where it started.
 So over the following year, I went to Hacker's Congress, Paralimni Police in Prague.
 And I was fortunate enough to meet now one of my co-founders, Eric Sirian.
 And yeah, he was explaining this idea called federated charming.
 I was explaining some ideas I had about getting people off exchanges.
 He politely told me that most of my ideas were terrible, but in a very polite way.
 And then he explained this federated charming mint idea.
 And from his point of view, it was a privacy solution.
 And it was an incredible privacy solution.
 But from my context in terms of trying to get people off exchanges, and my context of
 the global south, and especially West Africa, I realized that this was something much more.
 It was a new form of community decentralized custody.
 So instead of being your own bank, you could be your own community bank.
 And it stood some way between the gold standard, the Bitcoin standard of self-custody, and
 then this situation where we are right now, where most people are holding their money
 on exchange.
 And this was a really interesting middle ground.
 Yeah, it really stood out to me after I'd been out to El Salvador, because visiting
 El Zonte a few times, watching people collect their Bitcoin when they have these community
 events and then seeing them go back home.
 And I was starting to think about custody for these people, because I obviously have
 a multi-sig custody solution, cold storage for myself, which involves distributing keys
 into multiple locations and certain access rights.
 But it's very much a developed Western solution.
 And I was thinking, well, this person is going back to a place which is essentially like
 a constructed shack of sorts.
 Not that I'm being derogatory towards it, it's just the reality of their situation.
 I was thinking, well, how does this person self-custody?
 They have a phone.
 Can they afford a hardware wallet?
 If they can, where are they hiding it?
 If they're going to back up their private key, again, where they're hiding it?
 If they're going to do multi-sig?
 I was just like, this doesn't work.
 Something like Carcer has a multi-sig solution is great if you're in a developed Western
 nation and you can afford it.
 And at the time, I was just really struggling.
 We talked about it on the show and I didn't know how it was going to be solved.
 And once I heard about these federated mints, I was like, oh, hold on a second.
 This is a potential solution for these communities.
 Yeah, I think it's...
 And for some people, it could be this process of graduation to self-custody.
 But I think the full process was, right now we're at point A, and we want to get to point
 Z or Z for you, the US audience.
 It's Z, yeah.
 We want to get to Z.
 And Z is hyper-Bitcoinization globally.
 Now, most of the solutions that I've seen around custody take us from A to B to C. So
 they're better custody, they improve upon where we are.
 But what we did is look at, well, what does the world look like when everybody's using
 Bitcoin, when there are billions of people using Bitcoin?
 And when you look at that world, a few things become clear.
 One, the vast majority of people will be using Lightning as their daily driver.
 That's what they will be using for transactions and so on, receiving and sending.
 People receiving it for salaries, people will be receiving it as a merchant and spending
 money to buy goods and services, as well as holding.
 And also, just given the limitations of the Bitcoin network at the base layer, the majority
 of people will not be transacting on-chain most of the time, if ever.
 So once you realize that, and you realize that we're going to go from a world where
 most people right now have multiple UTXOs to their name, if they're holding Bitcoin,
 to a world where UTXOs will be shared by multiple people, then you need some way of doing that
 which isn't holding it on an exchange.
 Because at the moment, the only choice that you have is to have that sort of world is
 everybody storing it in a centralized manner with effectively a stranger, someone you don't
 know whose incentives, as we've seen time and time again, often don't align with your
 own.
 Yeah.
 Or they can make mistakes.
 Or people can hack things.
 And there's just that risk of holding that.
 That's why we always encourage people to get their coins off the exchange.
 But it feels like it's more than just that, though.
 It feels like this is more of a-- it's a bridge between the fiat world and the Bitcoin world.
 And that, like you say, be your own bank.
 But this kind of access to a community bank, it feels like it's a little bit more goal-driven
 rather than commercially driven.
 I know you've raised funds, but it still feels more like you're trying to build what is the
 end solution for-- well, as you said, people use it-- the Zed.
 Yeah, when we started-- so when I met Eric, it was and remains and will always remain
 a Fedimint that is the core protocol, this protocol for what I like to call the third
 pillar of the Bitcoin open source ecosystem.
 Yeah, explain the three.
 So the first pillar is decentralized, censorship-resistant money, the store of value.
 That's Bitcoin itself.
 And it's almost like this foundational layer.
 But the next is decentralized, censorship-resistant payments.
 And that's the Lightning Network.
 That gives you a mechanism to scale the store of value to basically, theoretically, an unlimited
 amount of transactions if it's a well-structured network.
 And what was missing is this decentralized, censorship-resistant custody system so that
 people everywhere can custody Bitcoin without having to rely on a presumably regulated third
 party.
 And that was Fedimint.
 I know we're going to have to get into the details of how it's going to work.
 But the thing I was starting to think about is that there's obviously issues with buying
 from exchange, the big one, something that Matt O'Dell will smash me on the head and
 talk about, and there's issues with KYC, AML.
 And I know you're solving a custody solution.
 But will people be able to accumulate Bitcoin within a Chaumian mint and avoid exchanges
 totally?
 So I think the short answer is yes.
 What we are trying to do, to your previous question, is think about this solution holistically.
 So custody is a key part of it.
 Payments and settlement through Lightning is a key part of it.
 And obviously, the money itself is a key part of it.
 But we're not just focused on creating a great new form of community custody.
 We're focused on helping form societies or cities or towns that are hyper-Bitcoinized.
 We're defining-- just so we have a yardstick, we're defining hyper-Bitcoinized as more than
 50% or 51% of the community using Bitcoin every day.
 And that's by using-- not including just holding or just investing or just speculating, but
 buying, selling, using as a means to transfer other forms of value, like stablecoins or
 whatever it may be, every single day.
 And when you want to get to that target, it focuses the mind.
 So you have to solve or have to help promote solutions to the end-to-end.
 process. So if that means being able to transact in the store in the way that the user's comfortable
 with, or training them or educating them, that's all part of solving it. So we don't just plonk in
 the technology, but we provide training and infrastructure so they can use it end-to-end
 without having to rely on central third parties, if they so wished.
 And you obviously, I don't know, have you done any dev work or are you still scoping the dev work?
 Oh, we've done a lot of dev work.
 But it's not available yet, you can't create one, right?
 It will be available very soon. So we're hoping to have a Cygnet version of the Fedimint software.
 The aim is in August.
 And do you have a test town you're going to be placing this in, a test scenario you're working on?
 So we have multiple potential test towns or cities or countries.
 It's Bedford-Wyatt.
 Bedford, well, we can talk afterwards.
 Well, what's an ideal test community?
 But we have a series of criteria. So we're doing a couple of things. One,
 we're going to be rolling out the software.
 There's two different things.
 So there's this open source project, Fedimint,
 which we are working very hard to maintain its open source nature
 because we want it to be a protocol that everybody uses.
 We have a number of incredible donors and sponsors,
 providing donor and sponsorship for that.
 And then we have the commercial company, Fedi, which is working on a wallet,
 which will be likely the first wallet to implement the Fedimint protocol.
 So the timelines for those, they're obviously dependent because you can't roll out Fedi
 before Fedimint.
 So the Fedimint timelines, we're aiming for the end of this, before the end of this year,
 ideally within the next couple of months,
 to announce a version to be used by hackers, enthusiasts, and so on.
 So we can start kicking the tires and anyone can download that.
 What's the relationship between the two? Are they essentially two separate entities?
 They're two separate things. So it wasn't until a few months ago
 that we really started looking at FedEye or Fedi.
 You could call it FedEye because it sounds like Jedi.
 Sounds like the Fed.
 Oh, well, some people say that, but that's just coincidence.
 My Fed. Like be your own Fed.
 You can be your own Fed, yeah.
 So Fedimint has been worked on as an open source protocol.
 It is the actual decentralized custody system.
 It's run by members of your community, trusted members of the community.
 So each person will run a server and they work together to run,
 one, to manage a multi-signature wallet for any Bitcoin that's deposited to it,
 and also to manage this federated Chowmein Mint,
 which effectively creates these IOUs for the Bitcoin that can then be held by you
 on your mobile app or viewed and accessed by users.
 And the Chowmein Mint is highly private and privacy preserving.
 It's a very mature, old and established mechanism for providing privacy
 within this sort of walled garden of the Federation.
 So that protocol is available and has been worked on for a number of years.
 Prior to...
 Predates your work?
 Well, no. Prior to my...
 Well, yes, and the idea of Chowmein Mint predates federated Chowmein Mint.
 Prior to my meeting Eric, he'd been working on that
 for over a year and was being sponsored by Blockstream.
 The idea originally came about, I like to say, a bit like Bitcoin.
 There were a number of different things that preceded it, sometimes by decades,
 but finally got to a point where all of it was available for the idea to appear.
 And when it did, a few people tried to work on it in parallel.
 So if you look at the constituent elements,
 first of all, in early 1983, we had Chowmein,
 the ideas behind Chowmein Mints and blinded signatures by David Chowm,
 who was one of the people referenced in Satoshi's white paper.
 And this was the lead up to the idea of Chowmein Mints.
 But, so this was this sort of privacy preserving protocol,
 but it required money, cash, to be sent to a centralized entity, a bank.
 He posited it would be a bank.
 You send them cash, fiat cash, and then they would give you these IOUs for that cash.
 So it trusted.
 So it was trusted, well, the money was trusted because it used fiat,
 because Bitcoin didn't exist.
 And also the actor was trusted as well.
 One central actor, the bank.
 But you trusted one person and you trusted the money,
 but ignoring those two points of trust,
 you had within the walled garden of the Chowmein Mint,
 you had cryptographically and theoretically perfect privacy.
 1989, I believe, he launched DigiCash,
 which was implementing a Chowmein Mint.
 And he worked, partnered with banks to receive money,
 and then they would implement the system.
 And that shut down at the end about 10 years later.
 Fast forward to 2008, 2009, white paper, and then the launch of the Bitcoin network.
 So now, for the first time, you had a money where it could be owned by multiple people.
 Because up until that, you cannot, we cannot all take or manage access to a dollar note.
 We're all holding it in our hand and paying.
 Maybe we could, but it's not very practical.
 But you can do that with Bitcoin because you have the concept of multi-signature.
 What's addresses, so multiple people can take ownership.
 So that was, again, a big milestone.
 And it's also a mutable privacy preserving meritocratic money.
 So you now have the potential of the money being replaced by cash, by fiat.
 And then fast forward 2016, 17, the Blockstreams Liquid Network was launched.
 And that gave us the ability to effectively have multiple people working together to perform
 some sort of programming task.
 Effectively, it's similar conceptually to multi-party computation,
 but it's actually different.
 But the idea you can work together to coordinate to perform a task.
 So once that came out, you had all the constituent elements.
 And within months of that, Eric and a number of other, no, two other, I believe,
 cypherpunks, hackers, really accomplished programmers,
 who would often meet in places like Parallel Police, Hacker's Congress, and so on.
 How could we combine these elements of, maybe let's combine Xiaomi and Mint,
 but instead of swap out the fiat with Bitcoin,
 and the ability for multiple people to take access to Bitcoin,
 and then swap out one bank with a federation,
 because the Liquid came up with the idea of federations,
 but a federation of people working together,
 the same people are holding the keys also to run the Xiaomi and Mint.
 So we can effectively federate this form of privacy,
 which is an incredibly strong privacy guarantees.
 Okay.
 So can you talk, walk me through how it physically works, like the process?
 So if I say in here...
 I'll try my best.
 Try your best.
 Say here in Bedford, I'm like, you know what,
 we need a community federated Mint, I want to create one.
 What is it I actually do, like in terms of the community I have to build to manage it,
 and then technically to deliver it?
 Yeah.
 So yeah, let's say you're in Bedford, and you've got Danny, yourself,
 and well, first of all, the first thing you, you as a community,
 would do is decide who within your community,
 have a track record of being trustworthy.
 People who maybe...
 So you may not include yourself in that list.
 But people I like to think who prioritized social capital,
 at least as much as they prioritize financial capital.
 Because if you think about the incentives,
 you're asking these people to look after capital, so financial capital.
 So if they prioritize social capital very highly,
 I honor standing in the community and so on,
 that will probably be a good, good starting point.
 And over your liFedime of being in the community,
 so you're going to have an idea of people who just,
 you know, the track record of just being, you know,
 knights, almost like honorable, you know, trustworthy, reliable, etc, etc.
 So you find a group of those,
 and they agreed to be what we like to call guardians of the federation.
 So being a guardian is,
 other than just having good character and so on,
 doesn't require too much.
 We're going to try and make it as simple as possible.
 You're going to need to run a Bitcoin full node,
 and the FedEmint software, the protocol.
 So we're going to work with people like Raspi Blitz,
 Umbrell, Noddle, etc, Start9,
 to make this sort of really, really easy.
 You basically download the software,
 or you buy one of these devices,
 and it will be an option there to install FedEmint.
 Then you're going to need to, as part of the setup process,
 and again, you run,
 the longest part is like syncing the Bitcoin full node.
 FedEmint's part is only a few moments more.
 And as part of the setup,
 you're going to basically provide
 what are the IP addresses of the other federation members.
 Let's say you found five in a village of 500.
 So you put the IP addresses of the other people,
 and the system will self-organize, connect,
 and set up a federation.
 - And what is actually created when a federation is created?
 - So there are two parts.
 One, you will personally set up a public private key for one guardian,
 if you are one of the guardians,
 a public private key for yourself and your own part of the multisig.
 And once that's done, you will do two things.
 You will form a multisignature wallet
 by coordinating with the other guardians,
 and you'll also form this sort of,
 almost like a decentralized service,
 which is the the Xiaomi main service,
 which is able to issue, create new IOUs,
 and is also able to destroy those IOUs,
 and is also able to convert.
 Think of it like a software equivalent of a kiosk telemachine.
 So think about the example of you're going to a fairground,
 and there's a kiosk there at the entrance.
 And when you go into the fairground,
 there's lots of rides and so on,
 you can give them your cash,
 and they take your cash,
 and then they, in this example,
 they take a piece of paper and they just write a number of notes,
 different tokens that represent different amounts of money,
 representing up to the equivalent amount of cash you're giving them,
 and they give them to you.
 And you can now go around onto rides,
 and you can use them.
 If you don't have enough, the right change,
 you can come back to the kiosk and say,
 "Can you give me a change for this £10 note that they gave you?"
 And they can replace it with £10, £1 notes,
 and then you can give you change as well.
 And if they ever receive a token from you,
 they destroy that, and they create new ones.
 And if you are leaving the fairground,
 you can go back with whatever notes you have,
 and you can give them,
 you can choose to give some or all of them to the kiosk,
 and they will look at the total value, destroy them,
 and then go back to their safe
 and take some of the cash they have
 to the equivalent amount and give that to you.
 So those are the things that they can do.
 And the elements in terms of the system
 is the safe to store the cash,
 and then the ability to,
 and then the piece of paper and pen which gives them,
 and the bin,
 affecting its ability to create IOUs and destroy IOUs.
 And so those are the two bits
 that each guardian is managing the system to create
 and destroy the IOUs.
 That's the Charmy Mint,
 and the ability to be part of the multi-sig
 that's holding the Bitcoin.
 - So say we found five people,
 we create the multi-sig,
 do we have a choice whether it's a three or five
 or a four or five and all those things?
 I guess there's no limitation,
 you could have 20 people or 10 of 20 or...
 - So these are implementation things that we're dealing
 'cause we want to balance functionality
 with performance, with simplicity as well.
 But fundamentally,
 there's no reason why there's a limitation.
 There is logically you don't want less than four,
 maybe three,
 because you want to have a situation
 where no one party has the ability to block a transaction.
 So the logical minimum of that will be three,
 so that two people can always make sure a transaction happens.
 And there's also limitations on the largest number,
 just from a performance point of view,
 'cause more people,
 the more coordination needs to happen to sign transactions
 or perform any action on the system.
 So although there's no hard and fast limits,
 it's likely that most will be between three,
 four, five on the low end
 and sort of 15, 16 to 20 on the high end.
 - So say here in Bedford,
 I find 10 members of the community
 that I think they're upstanding members that we trust,
 want to do this with,
 and let's say, I don't know,
 let's call it a five of 10 for the sake of this.
 - You'd probably want to make it show
 that there's a majority need to sign,
 so a six of 10.
 - Six of 10.
 So say we have the six of 10,
 what are the things they're having to sign?
 And is it a manual process each time?
 - So they need to download the FedEmint software.
 And again, it will normally be automatic
 as part of something like an Umbrella,
 Raspi Blitz, Start9, not all that sort of system.
 And just like the Bitcoin node,
 this is going to be an unattended operation system.
 So once you've downloaded it
 and you've put the IP addresses of everybody else
 and kept the backup of your own private keys,
 other than running out of hard drive space
 in three, four years time or something like that,
 general maintenance or restarting a machine if it fails,
 and which hopefully won't do very often,
 just like a Bitcoin node will just sit there and run.
 You just have to keep it fed and watered
 with electricity and internet.

 And also today we have the Pacific Bitcoin Conference hosted by Swan Bitcoin on November the 10th and 11th
 2022 in sunny Los Angeles
 Now I've known Corey Yan and Brady for years and they've been pulling out all the stops to make the Pacific Bitcoin
 Conference a celebration of the Bitcoin community
 I'm going to be emceeing the conference alongside my friends Natalie Brunel and Stefan Rivera
 And there's going to be an incredible lineup of speakers including Lynn Alden Alex Glastine and Preston Pish
 Now Pacific Bitcoin is going to be the right mix of education and good fun with unique experiences
 They've got a surfing simulator and loaded with other events and parties before and after the event
 They're bringing the brightest minds in Bitcoin to discuss a range of topics from macro to nation-state adoption
 Mining and lightning and you're not going to want to miss this inaugural Pacific Bitcoin Conference
 I know it's gonna be a special event now Swan are offering a huge 30% discount to listeners of the show
 Just go to Pacific Bitcoin comm and use the code Peter at checkout. That is
 PAC I F I see BIT co in
 calm and use the code Peter and
 Say we create this
 E cash for Bedford because it's essentially an e cash token that's created based on the Bitcoin
 Is that that's what the time I think for it is it's it's
 E cash is the protocol charming e cash. Yes, and it is a form of IOUs, but just for
 To avoid confusion, it's it's still effectively Bitcoin because you can spend it the user experience will be
 Like Bitcoin it should but but yes within the Federation. It's it's these IOUs
 Giving access to a pot of Bitcoin that's being held. Yeah
 I'm thinking in like UX. I'm going back to my UX days thinking in UX like I've I've
 Say Danny's created and I won't want to get some of this
 This Bitcoin within this
 Chaumian mint do I say do I speak to Danny or is there just a public address I go to and I send
 The the the Bitcoin to it and I get this other
 token representation back so
 So you want to receive some in the example you want to receive some Bitcoin or no
 I want I want to I want to use this federated mint. I'm working in the community
 I want some of this this bit this version of Bitcoin. Yeah, do I is there just like a public address?
 I just send it to an immediately send something. But how do I actually exchange?
 Exchange process. So what you want to do is join join the Federation. Okay, so
 So it's taking back take it step by step. So one thing I didn't go into because I
 Is the privacy properties of the charming mint in the example of the kiosk? Okay, but that's that's a separate issue
 Yeah, the whole privacy thing. Yeah, we can come back to that but
 So what you would do is the first of all a Federation setup, so it requires let's say five or ten people
 That you trust are in this community. They all download this piece of software and effectively click run and put everybody's IP addresses
 and those IP addresses could be in a form of a QR code and they can scan each other's QR codes and
 They're set up and run and once it's all configured and running. It's it just operates as
 Guardians as long as they just keep the machines
 having electricity and internet going to them that's
 For the day to day all they need to do all signing all transactions happen in a in an unattended way
 okay, so
 When they when they have set this up all of them will
 from there the interface of an order will be given the address the location of the
 Federation but this that's now being created and it will probably also show in a form of a QR code as well
 So they then download a Fedimint aware wallets Fedi will will be the first but we're hoping there'll be others and we're expecting
 The others will come just like there are multiple lightning wallets and so on or existing what is can be in integrated functionality as well
 So they download and say Fedi
 and
 The the guardians themselves and will scan the QR code that was displayed on there the device
 Which is the location of the Federation and that's it there
 They're signed up. They're done. They've they've they've become a member of their own Federation and can anyone join any Federation?
 Anyone can join any Federation? Yes
 because it's
 Cryptographically near perfect privacy. So there's no way to know who can join. However
 if you wanted the the people to help with the recovery of your keys in the event of
 You losing your phone or and not keeping all your backups and so on which is one of the things that frightens many people
 from self-custody
 you would need to be able to show that there's some they will need to know who you are to be able to
 Help you recover. And so that leads to a social limitation, even though there's no technical limitation
 You're you're you'd have to just be accept the chance that it'll be very hard for for them to say, okay
 Random strangers come up and asks for something back. And so that that leads to this is this
 Limitation, but it's not not a technical one. Okay, so yeah, so I
 so another user comes along and
 wants to join the Federation, let's say Danny and it will come up to you and
 Say I'm interested in joining Federation. You'll take your mobile app. You'll click the name of a Federation
 I'll show you the QR code of the Federation and they will scan it with their version of the app and they will join no
 Jane and
 They could potentially depending on how we want to design the find the UX
 We could allow it only guardians to allow people to join or anyone who's a member can allow anyone to join
 That's a UX decision that we're deciding but let's say anyone can allow anyone to join
 then Danny can go up to someone else and
 That person says, you know what? I'm you you you're always going on about this Bitcoin thing
 Okay, I finally get it. How do I get this thing? And instead of saying
 Join it join an exchange that you can instead say here just download this up
 And scan this QR code done. And can you imagine people joining multiple federations? Yes
 Yeah, so in that scenario does does it require the the token within that Federation to have its own name?
 No, it will always it will always appear as Bitcoin within within the Federation, but you should think about
 Think about if there's an app like slack where you have multiple different slacks
 You can join or discord multiple different discords and within each discord you have different conversations. They're not the same conversation, but they're all
 conversations
 and so
 but
 There's no way of directly transferring a conversation from one slack to another. Yeah, but this is where the power of
 Either on chain or on network. You don't need to have that ability because you can instantly or near instantly use the lightning network or
 Relatively quickly use on chain transactions, although we expect multiple people to use lightning network to transfer between
 federations or between
 federations and and other lightning wallets because the the lightning network is
 A standard that allows for the interchange between any rate anything that's lightning aware
 But is it is it like liquid once I you know, once I put my Bitcoin in there and I get liquid Bitcoin
 It's it's a different thing
 Because the bitcoins held in a multi-sig it's it's it conceptually it's similar
 but instead of one liquid network used by everybody those hundreds of thousands potentially of
 Fedimints used by different communities and to send between them
 Your you're not penalized by that because the send between them you use the lightning network
 And so it still just takes a second to send between them or to send out to something. That's not in within the Federation
 So you could if Danny's in one Federation, I'm in another I can still send in my Bitcoin from my Federation to his
 yeah, and I'll take a second or or
 however long the lightning transaction takes to operate or if Danny has a
 wallet Satoshi or a strike wallet or a moon wallet or
 Or a coin corner wallet or any number of the other lightning aware wallets
 They could send to you you could just show him within your your interface from your point of view
 It would look like a lightning wallet and you would use say create invoice and it will show the QR code
 He's he's in Australia looking through a zoom conversation or a keats conversation nowadays
 soon and and he can
 Scan it and the payment will be sent over the lightning network
 So you're not penalized by being within that Federation, which is why it works so well
 With the lightning network, it becomes much more practical because to otherwise to transfer in and out
 Securely will be like like liquid you'd have to wait a number of block transactions and so on and block
 Confirmation. Sorry one. So what I'm trying to understand is the Federation is created
 yeah, and
 To join the Federation I
 Click the QR code. I've been accepted. I'm now in the Federation. Yeah, and then I send
 Bitcoin to a an address and that gives me this Bitcoin. How do I get this Bitcoin?
 How do you receive?
 My Bitcoin into this Bitcoin
 You would you would have an app you would have the let's say the Fed app
 Yeah, you've just joined you scan the QR code you've joined and then you'll say create
 better you for example, you could say
 create invoice and
 Just like with a lightning any other lightning wallet
 Although we're aiming our user interface to be really really simple, but it's the same as any other lightning wallets
 Conceptually you'd create invoice you say the amount you want to receive
 like a thousand so she's sets and then it'll show a lightning invoice and then you would have a
 novel wallet say that's a lightning wallet, for example, and
 You would that's that's connected to the to the lightning network with your own
 Bitcoin in it or
 You've got an exchange account that supports the lightning network
 it can also do on chain by the way, but I'm just giving you a network example to begin with and
 you would paste in the
 The lightning network if the lightning invoice or if it supports scanning you would you would just scan the QR code
 And then a lightning transaction would would occur sending the money to this address
 If you don't have a wallet that supports the light network and it's a normal wallet
 Then you would say invoices a Bitcoin transaction
 and it will show you the address to send Bitcoin to and
 you would then
 Within your Bitcoin wallet send an amount to that Bitcoin address and after a number of confirmations
 It will appear in your wallet as as capable of being spent by you
 And so that Bitcoin I've said I paid that invoice
 Does that go into like a like a hole like into a vault that goes into a multi signature wallets?
 Yeah managed by the ten guardians. Yeah, and I get an I and then once it's had enough confirmations
 To avoid things like rollbacks on the on the main chain and so on similar to how liquid works
 This is if you do it on chain on chain
 That's not required for lightning
 then the
 Federation
 Guardians machines will know that a number just they'll be following the software and software says a number of confirmations gone by
 okay, we can create an equivalent number of of
 Ekesh tokens for which to be used
 IOUs effectively to be used within the system and
 Make them available to be picked up by by the user
 Okay, so it almost puts those into a vault and gives me a representation. So it's a two machines
 Yeah
 so like that's like the kiosk example the the multi-sig wallet is the example of of a of a vault of a
 Safety box behind them and then the piece of paper and the pen and the bin is
 The creation and destruction of the IOUs that relate to it. So you receive some cash you put it in the vault
 that's the multi-sig and at the same time you then create, you know, one dollar one dollar one dollar five dollar and
 250 cents and and then you create those you give them to the person in the replacement. They can use them within
 within the
 Within the fairgrounds as much as they want they can pass them around to other people within the fairground. It's a bearer asset
 But it acts like cash in that system if they say well, you know
 I want to buy this ride for two dollars and I've only got five dollar a five dollar note left
 You go back to the kiosk and say can you give me five one dollars?
 Tokens instead and they take the five dollar token destroy it give five one dollar tokens back. Oh, so I have exact denominations
 It's like cash
 Like a bearer cash it operates the way you've people think
 Bitcoin Bitcoin operates when they first hear about it, so we can't you can't do change
 Well you you just the way you do change with normal cash
 You'd go to the kiosk and ask for change you go to the bank and get change
 Just so it's it's it's the way we've been learned to deal with fear with physical cash
 Okay, and that says and also you can send it directly between people because each note has its own
 Is its own thing or each token or each coin?
 So but all of these things are happening by the way to you automatically by the software
 Yeah, of course
 So when it's the change that right it will just send a message and I've got 95% of what I need them bits
 that's missing you send it sends a message off to the
 to the to the mint and that will destroy that and give you back a set of
 Change in a fraction of a second as you pay if it's all automatic. That's why I want to know
 Yeah
 About the stuff because I'm trying to think in terms of the user
 Yeah from the users point of view it looks exactly like what they expect
 I literally go to the machine and say I need three one
 it's all happening automatically, but but it's also just what's happening at a technical level and what's happening at a
 Experiential level experientially it will look like a lightning wallet to a normal user lightning wallet, which is really simple to use
 But signup involves scanning a QR code and so that's it
 And so say to me and Danny in the same Federation
 I send half a Bitcoin to it and I get this half a Bitcoin worth of e-cash
 Yeah, but from your point of views you've given a lightning voice and you received half a Bitcoin
 Well, so you said it could be base chain or lightning. Yes. Yeah, so
 Are we saying that?
 like is it like moon wallet where mine won't know the difference or will I actually have like a base chain and
 Lightning wallet within the Fedi wallet. So the final UX to be decided but but for the purpose, so there's three different
 Because you asked an interesting
 Question in terms of the nuance but there's three different types of transactions
 effectively, okay, one is
 intra Federation between one Federation member another Federation member and that's e-cash
 Directly and it doesn't that's actually at a third layer if you say base layers Bitcoin layer two is lightning. This is happening in
 Multiple sharded layer freeze we have hundreds of thousands of shoddy layer freeze effectively each one being its own
 Scaling layer so any transaction happening within that Federation within that village or in that town doesn't even touch
 Not only does it not touch the base layer, but it doesn't touch the the network either the lightning network
 Yeah, yeah, but and then you have any transaction between a
 Someone within a Federation and someone outside of a Federation but over the lightning network
 So that could be someone who's got their own lightning node or someone is using a centralized
 lightning a service
 or someone who's using
 One of these sort of semi centralized decentralized services or another Federation someone who's in another
 Federation somewhere else all of those will go over the lightning network and then finally there'll be transactions
 to the base to sending money out the system to
 the base chain or
 receiving money from the base chain now the first two
 The way we're currently designing the system
 They're gonna be the most frequent ones and they will visually look the same
 So they will both look like lightning transactions, even if you're sending it to someone else within the Federation
 So the ones that most people do somewhere between 99 to 100% of the time
 they will look the same but because the format of
 A Bitcoin transaction versus a lightning invoice and the way it works is a lightning lightning invoice the normal
 Modus operandi is invoice and then pay invoice
 versus
 Address and send money to an address. It might be that the UX for that is slightly different
 then the UX for sending to a
 Lightning address, which is what you see on on
 Lightning what's a day? Yeah have a separation between on chain and lightning, but there won't be a third separation between
 lightning and Federation to Federation, but say Danny's not in the Federation and I am and
 He says me a lightning invoice. I can pay that with my from my federated wallet
 So yeah, exactly and vice versa
 and so what happens is it when I pay that does it burn say it's a thousand does it burn my thousand sats of like
 The federated e-cash and then send him from like the the centralized. Okay, so here's a
 No, it doesn't do that
 and this is really interesting so
 What happens and this is actually another really exciting bit about it
 so
 As I mentioned in the structure, there's no yet there's no lightning node or in in
 The way it's currently architected for running being a guardian
 At some point in future we might consider
 consider adding that, but right now there isn't.
 So a Guardian has got a Bitcoin node, and it's got the FedEmint software, effectively,
 which makes the Bitcoin node is able to coordinate with others to make a multi-sig.
 And it's also able to create this Charming Mint.
 But there is no Lightning node.
 So how is it able to interact with the Lightning network?
 It's a question.
 And the question is that it doesn't do it directly.
 It creates this incentive structure to incentivize Lightning service providers, so people who
 are running Lightning nodes, but with the view to try and make profit from it, to connect
 up with the Federation.
 And the way they do that is this.
 They will also join-- say you're running a Lightning service provider.
 You're running a Lightning node.
 So you're part of the Lightning network.
 You're relaying Lightning transactions and earning a fee whenever you do.
 You will then say, you see there's this Federation, which is a town or a village of 500, 600 people
 all wanting to make and receive Lightning transactions.
 So it's a very lucrative source of revenue for you.
 You can join that Federation, and then you can make yourself available as a Lightning,
 what we call a Lightning gateway, between the Federation and the Lightning network.
 And so what happens is instead of-- you normally form channels, payment channels on the Lightning
 network.
 You form, for want of a better phrase, ghost channels, which act and operate like a Lightning
 channel, but it's actually not a Lightning channel.
 They're taking the Federated--
 So what will happen is when this person makes a transaction, when you look to pay the invoice
 to Danny, who's using a Lightning wallet that's connected to the Lightning network directly
 or in another Federation, what actually happens is-- and it's all transparent to you.
 It's just you're paying the invoice.
 But your e-cash is sent from you to the Lightning gateway, which is the LSP who is connected
 up to your Federation.
 And so it's not destroyed.
 It's just sent to their balance.
 So their balance of e-cash tokens increases.
 And then they, on the Lightning network--
 Pay out.
 Pay out.
 Yeah.
 OK.
 But because this is replicating the hash time, not contract payment channel logic, the Lightning
 network, this ghost channel, it's still transactional.
 If it fails, then no one ends up requiring trust.
 The LSP does require trust in the Federation, though, because they're holding tokens for
 the period of time they're holding tokens.
 But they don't require trust with you.
 It's like a Lightning channel.
 But what's incredible about that is this ghost channel, it doesn't cost necessarily to open
 and close this or manage this.
 So effectively, you can open up channels with all of the members of the village, but use
 the same capital across all of them.
 So that gives you a number of capital efficiency benefits.
 Imagine you had 500 separate people you had to open up a channel with, and you had to
 lock up 0.1 Bitcoin with them.
 Instead you have 500 people, and you could maybe only lock up-- that in total would be
 5 Bitcoin you have to lock up.
 Now you could maybe only lock up half a Bitcoin and still service 500 people, meaning that
 you can service more people.
 And it becomes more profitable.
 If it's more profitable, more people set up Lightning nodes, and more people become Lightning
 service providers, making the network more reliable.
 And say it's a base chain transaction.
 So I've got my federated e-cash, and I want to send Danny some base chain.
 Does it then burn it?
 Danny's very lucky.
 Danny's a lot of Bitcoin of me.
 He's got a lot more than me now.
 But say I want to send the transaction to him.
 He's given me his address.
 What actually happens there?
 Do I-- can I do that?
 Can I just send to his like batch 32 address?
 Yes.
 Yeah, you can.
 But what would the wallet do?
 Send it back to the-- In that case, when you want to send on-chain,
 it would effectively send it back to the mint.
 And then they will take those IOUs, shred them, and put them in the bin.
 And at the same time, go to the safe at the back, and take out the equivalent amount of
 cash, and send it to the address that you used to send.
 So what does it do in terms of fees then?
 Because if I want to send Danny $0.50 on the base chain, it's like pointless, because the
 fees could at some point be higher.
 Do the fees match?
 So the fees that will be charged get passed on to the person.
 So it will come out.
 Do you think that there will come a time where people won't know whether they're sending
 to a mint or not?
 Is there a distinguishing feature of the addresses?
 They are multi-sig.
 So you know you're sending to a multi-sig.
 There are potential updates to, for example, taproot or so on, and other features that
 could make it-- if we chose to implement it, we will be implementing taproot.
 But if we chose to, we can make it so that it's actually not visible to know the difference
 between a multi-signature transaction or not.
 In which case, even now, you know it's multi-sig, but that doesn't tell you that it's a federation.
 And once you use a certain address format, you won't even know it's distinguishable from
 a single sig or a multi-sig.
 I think I get that.
 And the guardians get paid to do their work?
 So that's a very, very interesting question.
 The guardians could be paid, or they could not be paid.
 The default and recommended approach is that you seek out people who do not wish to be
 paid.
 But that is not something that we-- there's nothing in the protocol that ensures that
 or forces that.
 That's just based on our current view of best practice and our current view of finding as
 many mechanisms as possible to give tools for users to fit within exemptions around
 regulation.
 So there are multiple-- so regulation is a very complex subject.
 And it's jurisdiction-based.
 And you should always seek your own advice and so on with all these sort of things.
 But having run an exchange for eight years-- and it was the first exchange we regulated
 in Gibraltar-- and spent a lot of time with a lot of regulatory advisors and so on and
 so forth, you become aware of certain exemptions which exist around regulation.
 And one of the things that became clear with FediMint and federations was that it all
 already naturally fits within certain exemptions.
 And so why not try and make people aware of some of these and fit in as many as possible?
 So some of the exemptions or cases around, for example, Bitcoin nodes operations, because
 they're unattended operation, that is a indication that it could be-- all these are indications.
 Nothing is ever given black and white in regulation.
 But unintended operation is a good indication of something being potentially out of regulation.
 Could you not be considered a money transmitter in the US?
 Again, it depends on where.
 But if you're operating in an unattended manner-- again, you should always seek advice.
 But if you're operating in an unattended manner, if you are doing something-- and this is one
 of the strongest exemptions-- is if you're doing something that is not by way of business,
 that is an exemption which you see in multiple reasonable jurisdictions.
 And that's why if you're not looking to make money from running this, that would-- and
 you're doing it for people you had a pre-existing social relationship with, friends and family,
 and that would seem to fit the evidence that you're not running it by way of business.
 And the reason why that is an exemption is if you think about it logically, imagine the
 number of times you perform something that could be considered a regulated activity,
 but you're doing it for friends and family and not looking to make money.
 If I'm holding money in a piggy bank for my son, am I a custodian?
 Would I need to be regulated?
 If I'm going to the shops and taking money for my friends to buy something on the way
 to shops, am I a money transmitter?
 If I go and say, yeah, you should buy Bitcoin, am I a financial advisor?
 If you're not looking to make money from it and you're doing it by way of for friends
 and family or people with pre-existing relationships with-- again, obviously, these things will
 all have to be-- it's always case-dependent and country-dependent.
 But that is a stated exemption in the UK, in the US.
 And another one is a third one, which we are-- just by nature of the system we fall within,
 is again, another test is whether you have the agency to act individually.
 And because, again, you could set it up to be a one-of-one federation, but then that
 doesn't seem to have-- that's why we would recommend to have at least three or four,
 because then no one person has the ability to make a transaction without others.
 So again, you don't have agency to move money individually.
 No guardian has that.
 If you're not looking to make a profit, then you're not doing something by way of-- and
 you're doing it for people you have a pre-existing relationship with.
 If it's just operating and in the main-- the day-to-day operation is just sitting there
 in a room, in a box, and you're not doing anything, again, that's another area.
 If you choose to not implement, the more of those you implement, the more it would give
 you a tool to say that you're not doing this by way of business and be exempt.
 The less you do it, the more you'd have to seek advice.
 Can the signers in the federation collude and steal the Bitcoin?
 If the majority of-- the answer is yes, if it's the majority of guardians, yes.
 So is there a risk here in a scenario, say there was-- OK, let's say Bedford again.
 We set up three or five, three trusted members.
 And this mint starts to grow into quite a decent size.
 And the Bitcoin does what it does.
 It goes up in value.
 And I wouldn't do it, but just say I did.
 Say I said, you know what, guys?
 There's a few million here.
 Let's steal this and do one.
 Does that exist as a risk?
 And how much have you thought that through?
 Because it--
 We spend a lot of time thinking it through.
 Because I'm just wondering, the thing I'm thinking is, is it a little bit-- are we going
 to be encroaching on a little bit on that, not your keys, not your Bitcoin?
 You're kind of giving up your private keys.
 So there's two parts to that question.
 I'll start with the last part first.
 Sorry, and I need to throw one other thing in there.
 OK, I might forget then.
 My memory is--
 No, no, just to make it make logic.
 So if we still stole the Bitcoin from the mint, does that automatically burn the other
 coins that exist within the wallets?
 No.
 And people find out when they try to withdraw, and it was fraction reserve, effectively.
 And so you won't know if you draw it.
 You try to withdraw, and there's no money to withdraw.
 And it will fail.
 Can that happen, then?
 If the majority of guardians collude, then yes, they can move Bitcoin individually.
 Because they have a multi-signature wallet.
 So if they work together, they can take the Bitcoin off, which is why it's important to
 choose people who you trust to have a background of prioritizing social capital over financial
 capital.
 No, and I can think of some great examples.
 Michael Pedersen in El Salvador, I would say him as a federation.
 You can really trust in Jorge there as well.
 I can think of a group of people.
 But I'm just saying, if these federations become quite commonplace, you can't help people
 police everyone who is part of them.
 Does it exist?
 Is this something that can happen?
 There's a lot of questions I might--
 I know.
 Basically, can it be stopped?
 But that's-- so first of all, can we do something?
 We think about it a lot.
 And one, the recommendations of-- to try and work with second party trusted relationship.
 And a second party is someone you have a pre-existing longstanding relationship with as a separate
 to a third party.
 It is a thing, a second party.
 A third party is someone that you-- is not yourself, first party, is not someone you
 have a pre-existing relationship with, so not friends, family, co-workers, and so on,
 but you've built a human level of understanding about how much you can trust them.
 And then there's a third party where it's basically someone you have no first-hand knowledge
 of other than what they've told you through advertising or media or giveaways or so on.
 But effectively, it's a stranger, and that's a third party.
 So we have recommended that having custodied many, many millions of people's money for
 eight years and seen what's happened and the incentives around third party custody.
 My strong recommendation is to go for second party trust because there's two things that
 people value, financial capital, but also social capital is something that is valuable
 in society.
 And there are some people who index very high on how much they value social capital.
 And then on top of that, we use technology to federate that.
 So now-- because obviously, people can always change.
 But if you have a group of them working together and you need more to them to collude, that
 will, we believe, will be a good step in terms of reducing.
 But it goes further than that because not only are they working together to collude,
 they'll have to work together to collude, which goes against their own social incentives.
 They'll be ostracized from the community that they've spent their life trying to build up
 a reputation with.
 But we as the producers of the system are looking to add in and bake in education and
 helpful information to guide people to protect them as well as much as we can.
 And obviously, some of this will be learning.
 There's no way you can guarantee we cover everything.
 But for example, when you join a federation, we will probably ask you to ask questions,
 for example, is this-- do you know the guardians of the federation?
 Have you-- has the person who introduced you informed you of that information?
 If you're not aware of who they are, then maybe you shouldn't join the federation, stuff
 like this.
 But there are various points when you-- along the way where-- especially as we're dealing
 with more and more people using Bitcoin, the average level of knowledge of how to safely
 handle your money will tend to reduce.
 So it's important we think-- and we think other wallets should do this as well-- bake
 in best practice guidelines to when receiving money, when sending money, when joining federations,
 about what you should do and what you should think about, like checklists.
 There's a great book called The Checklist Manifesto, which--
 Checklist Manifesto.
 It's an amazing book.
 It talks about how the power of just going through checklists massively reduced the--
 massively reduced the rate of plane crashes in the army.
 And also, it's had a bigger effect than any other intervention in reducing-- in increasing
 the positive outcomes in hospitals, because most of the time it's due to people just forgetting
 to do things.
 And so we're going to want to implement those sort of mindsets and ideas.
 Didn't that come up the other day when I was talking about checklists in the pub?
 You're a checklist maxi.
 But did The Checklist Manifesto come up?
 I don't know.
 I've got to dig that out.
 Yeah.
 It's a-- but it's a-- it's a great book.
 But it's a similar idea.
 Just keep checking things.
 And one thing that we could check, for example, is if it looks like the size of a mint-- because
 we can still observe the amount of money being held by the mint-- is above a certain size,
 we could say, look, you are holding this much money on this mint.
 Maybe you should consider splitting your money across multiple mints.
 And again, we can, as an app, say, look, we can observe that this size of mint is large.
 To move between mints is a lightning transaction.
 And it costs fractions of-- it could be done in seconds and so on.
 So and joining mints is so easy, you should decentralize your risk so we can, again, provide
 reminders.
 Because people might not think about that.
 But if it does--
 Or set up your own mints.
 If this mint that you're joining is becoming too large, maybe you should set up a--
 a smaller community for your family and so on,
 et cetera, et cetera.
 - It does remind me a little bit of,
 it's kind of taken one step back towards banking.
 I'm not saying this as a criticism,
 but like today I had to do a bank transfer.
 I bought a bed of all side of things.
 - In Bedford.
 - I didn't buy a bed in Bedford,
 I bought a bed from, I think it was Surrey.
 But when I put in the details,
 it asked me a couple of questions.
 Do you know them?
 Do you trust this company?
 Like it was like a checklist of things they asked me about.
 Now they asked me things that you wouldn't do
 as part of this.
 They were like, what do you buy?
 And they wanted to actually know some kind of,
 check the transaction kind of stuff,
 some KYC, AML kind of questions,
 like what do you buy and who's it for?
 But the first question, I've had it a few times,
 do you know, do you trust this person?
 Are these details correct?
 There's like these little checks in place.
 And it's just kind of interesting
 'cause I'm thinking you're trying to find solutions
 to the fact that this is,
 we're taking some Bitcoin from trustless to part trusted,
 but I guess you're saying like you're making it,
 you're focusing on the people who have exchanges,
 you've got full trust to be less trustless.
 - This is not about, I mean, some people who,
 'cause of the privacy guarantees that you get,
 will find it, if they're self-custoding,
 to take their spending money,
 and instead of spending it from their own set of private keys
 and their own wallet,
 sending it first to a federation
 and spending it within there,
 'cause it will improve their privacy,
 their personal privacy.
 So there will be that use case,
 but that's not our focus.
 If you see our site,
 our focus is about the fact that billions of people
 are either excluded from using either solution,
 so first party custody or third party custody,
 and the billions who are potentially capable
 of custodying,
 most of them are currently destined
 to be custody on exchanges.
 So we're talking about the 90 to 95%
 to either have no option
 or it's third party stranger custody as the option.
 And from that point of view,
 it's a step in the right direction.
 It's not about getting the people who have the ability,
 they have the monetary means,
 they have the technical means,
 and they just have the confidence,
 the self-confidence to self-custody.
 If you have all three of those,
 then you should definitely do that.
 That's the, as I say, that's the Bitcoin standard,
 that's the gold or the Bitcoin standard.
 And there are services like Casa, like Unchained and so on,
 who, if you have the monetary means
 and it's a larger amount that you're holding,
 that can help you and steer you through the path
 of doing it in a multi-signature manner
 and make sure that you follow best practice as well.
 But the idea of,
 but that's 5, 10, maybe 20% of the market.
 And we're talking about 80 to 90% of the market,
 which is currently destined to not have any option at all
 or to hold it on an exchange.
 And this is a step in the right direction.
 - Separately, in terms of checklists,
 that's just good for anyone.
 I would suggest even in a first party wallet
 and you're about to make a payment,
 it'd be good to ask questions, you know,
 'cause people, we see it, I see it a lot,
 especially it was very, it's still pervading now,
 but it was very pervading a few years ago
 in parts of West Africa, various scams.
 It was OneCoin, there was BitConnect,
 there were a few more, I've lost track of the number
 and people would fall for these scams
 and some would be storing Bitcoin first party.
 But if there was a reminder in the app to be careful,
 does it look like a Ponzi scheme or so on and so forth,
 that could have helped save people.
 If people want to turn off those notes
 and not have them, it's fine.
 But if we know that these are potential pitfalls
 or mistakes that people make,
 the value and benefit of just reminding people
 to think about these things
 before doing a transaction is,
 it doesn't affect decentralization,
 that's just about trying to help them
 in a way which is separate to anything external
 happening to them.
 So that way, 'cause you have to remember
 one of the most common ways of getting money from people
 is confidence tricksters will not do take,
 it won't be a technical approach,
 it'll be just you've built up confidence in me
 and I'm telling you to do this thing.
 If the app says, is anybody telling you to do this thing?
 Stop, then that's the final check.
 And so, and that's probably gonna be the most common way
 most people will be scammed or so on.
 - This show is brought to you by Gemini,
 who I am using exclusively for buying and selling Bitcoin,
 but I'm only ever buying, come on, we're hodlers,
 we're not sellers.
 I'm also using the Gemini app for buying the dips
 and I've been buying a lot of those recently.
 And I've also set up my DCA
 with twice monthly buys of Bitcoin.
 Both the app and the website make buying
 and selling Bitcoin super easy.
 And Gemini has invested in building
 industry leading security since day one.
 Gemini and now also running a special offer
 for listeners of what Bitcoin did.
 All you need to do is head over to gemini.com/wbd
 and new customers will get $20 in Bitcoin
 when they trade $100 or more on Gemini.
 Now, if you wanna find out more,
 please head over to gemini.com/wbd,
 which is G-E-M-I-N-I.com/WBD.
 Next up is my new sponsors, the Texas Blockchain Council.
 Now, on November the 17th and 18th,
 the Texas Blockchain Council are putting on
 the Texas Blockchain Summit in Bitcoin country, Austin, Texas.
 Now, you know how much I love out there.
 I'm gonna be attending.
 The event is two days of thought leadership for Bitcoin.
 Day one is all that any Texas Bitcoin miner could ask for.
 Top Bitcoin CEOs and their teams
 will be hanging out in Austin.
 And day two has top policy leaders from the US,
 both federal and state legislators, senators,
 House of Representatives, CFTC commissioners.
 What more could you ask for?
 Yes, I'm not just promoting this.
 I'll be attending the event in Austin,
 hanging out with my Texas Bitcoin buddies
 and interviewing someone very important on stage.
 So make sure you book your ticket,
 come to the event, let's hang out.
 To find out more, head over to texasblockchainsummit.org
 and use the discount code PETAMC20
 for a 20% discount at checkout
 and let them know that I sent you.
 This offer is valid until the end of October.
 Next up, it is BCB Group.
 BCB Group provide online business banking services
 for companies in the Bitcoin industry.
 And yes, I am a customer of BCB too.
 They heard about my difficulty
 with finding a payment services provider
 that understands Bitcoin and reached out to me.
 Now, BCB's clients include major exchanges,
 market makers, funds, and miners active in the UK and Europe,
 but they are expanding globally.
 They have an amazing network called Blink,
 which facilitates instant free payments
 between BCB clients and all supported currencies.
 Now, listen, I know some of you
 have had some trouble with this like me.
 And if you are looking for a banking provider
 who understands and supports Bitcoin companies
 rather than creating hurdles,
 then like me, you want to become a BCB customer.
 Now, if you want to find out more,
 please head over to bcbgroup.com/peta,
 which is B-C-B-G-R-O-U-P.com/peta.
 Also, we have my new sponsor, Wasabi,
 who I will be now using to make sure my Bitcoin is private,
 and I'm very excited about using their software.
 With the release of Wasabi 2.0,
 Bitcoin privacy is now effortless
 as the wallet has introduced privacy by default.
 Now, rather than having to choose to coin join,
 this can all be done automatically.
 So you just need to receive your Bitcoin,
 wait for the coin join, and then you can spend freely.
 All the magic happens automatically in the background,
 which is a massive UX improvement.
 You also get additional privacy through Tor integration
 into Wasabi 2.0, so you don't leak your IP address,
 and there are no more minimum denominations,
 so you can coin join any amount,
 and there's no more change.
 So any amount you receive from a coin join is private.
 Privacy is something
 I've been taking more seriously recently,
 and with Wasabi 2.0, this has made it so much easier.
 So definitely go and check it out.
 If you want to find out more,
 please head over to wasabiwallet.io,
 which is W-A-S-A-B-I-W-A-L-L-E-T dot IO.
 The trust spectrum is quite interesting,
 because we're talking about some people here
 trying to get them off exchange,
 and trying to get them to maybe use one of these mints,
 which kind of makes sense 'cause it's a better scenario.
 But I could also see a scenario
 where there are certain exchanges
 I would perhaps trust in certain mints
 because the company is so big.
 So Quadriga obviously put me in a position
 where I wouldn't trust any small exchange.
 But the top kind of three or five,
 like your Coinbase, your Gemini, your Krakens,
 in some ways, it's not that I don't trust
 the regulatory bodies around them,
 they force them to confiscate your coins,
 but I trust them not to fuck up losing my coins,
 and possibly more than I would trust
 maybe a two or three federation
 where I don't know the people.
 Do you see what I mean?
 There's like different trust models that go on here.
 - So I think the first point to say is that
 there's a spectrum.
 - Yeah, totally.
 - And everybody has to make their own decisions.
 And so if you're in a country which has rule of law,
 is not managed by dictatorship or authoritarian rule,
 by the way, you're already now at the minority of the world.
 - Gladstein would tell us that.
 - You're now at the minority of the world.
 And then you have exchanges
 that you feel that you can trust,
 and you're happy to pay the fees for doing that.
 And they're also happy to have you as a customer as well,
 because they're regulated entities.
 So therefore, by definition,
 they will have a criteria for who cannot join.
 By definition, that means some people don't fit the criteria.
 So you might wanna join them,
 they might not want to have you as a customer.
 So if you can get through all of those hurdles,
 and then you're free to make that choice.
 - I think a mistake I might be making though,
 is I'm kind of envisaging this from the privilege
 of a stable Western liberal democracy,
 where I've got multiple options in terms of
 kind of exchanges that built a solid reputation
 to multi-sig solutions to good hardware wallet access,
 whereas really you're solving a problem for people
 in much more challenging environments.
 For me, I see the privacy option is where essentially,
 if I wanna send to Danny, I send it into the Federation
 and then send from there, that totally makes sense.
 But I would never keep all my Bitcoin in a Federation.
 - I think people see the value of the privacy value of it,
 but also people who are currently in,
 even in the West who are in sort of uncle Jim mode,
 they're the Bitcoin knowledgeable person
 within their family and people are asking them
 to advise them on Bitcoin, help them buy Bitcoin,
 help them hold Bitcoin already.
 Again, people will be doing this in an ad hoc manner.
 This allows you to do it that,
 at least do that in a more better practice manner
 with lower efforts, 'cause instead of just being called
 every time they want to spend it,
 or you can now just set this up
 and you can still have the same experience.
 However, for the thinking globally,
 it seems that, and based on feedback,
 although there's a lot of interest in the West
 from a privacy point of view,
 there's a huge amount of interest from the global South.
 And that's an area where for right from the day one
 of starting at a coin floor,
 has been an area of interest for me
 in terms of Latin America, Middle East, Africa, of course,
 and also we're seeing a lot of interest
 in post-Soviet Europe as well.
 And these parts of the world where for monetary reasons
 or they're in areas of conflict,
 they're suffering under the yoke of authoritarian regimes
 and dictatorships.
 And this is again, more than half the world,
 millions of people we're talking about.
 They don't have those options.
 They often suffer under, we're talking about 10% inflation.
 Venezuela is 20,000% inflation.
 Currency controls, a lack of options for alternatives.
 They don't always, again, location is dependent,
 but some of these have very few,
 they're either unbanked or under banked
 as Andreas would say.
 And so we're talking about billions there.
 And if we help those billions, we've already won,
 but there will be, but this is a global product
 and different people, it's like a hammer.
 Different people will use the hammer to build a boat,
 a house or a piece of art,
 but it's a tool that can be used
 in different configurations.
 - Do I seem to be overly grilling you
 on this particular subject
 or has this come up quite a bit?
 - Which subject?
 - The idea that there is a,
 like a trust model based around the fact
 that people could collude.
 - I think the, no, it comes up a lot.
 I think it comes up 'cause most of the audience
 and the places that we're talking to
 are from the global's North or the West.
 And so there people really grill this,
 the idea of second party trust seems to be unusual.
 Although then when you say the Uncle Jim model,
 most people know either themselves without realizing it
 or know someone who is advising on Bitcoin
 or helping people by Bitcoin or holding Bitcoin
 on behalf of friends and family.
 But there is this sort of disconnect
 between even though they might be doing it themselves,
 believing that they won't be able to trust someone.
 So they're trusting, other people are trusting them,
 but believing that it's gonna be hard to find people
 who can trust a friend or family,
 even though they are being trusted at the very same time.
 - Well, we've seen that lawsuits in the UK
 where people have colluded on wills to try and steal.
 So even within family groups, there are trust issues.
 - No, trust issues can happen,
 but ultimately the solution is,
 we've got the ability to trust within family
 or you have to trust a stranger.
 And there's, which is what's the current option.
 And because the stranger is able to provide
 a flashy website, great advertising, great marketing,
 press a number of social buttons
 and UX buttons to make you feel safe.
 It doesn't change the fact that they may not,
 they could become a Krijger, they can become,
 I mean, we've seen recently many, many recent examples
 of regulated institutions breaking their customers' trust.
 So it's a question of trade-offs.
 The ultimate and ideal is for people to self-custody.
 And again, as part of the education and training
 within the app, above a certain level,
 we not only would say, not only this federation
 is becoming quite large in terms of the Bitcoin it's holding,
 maybe consider moving or splitting to reduce your risk.
 The app could also say, your amount of Bitcoin
 you're holding is becoming quite large.
 Maybe you should consider self-custody
 without realizing it.
 'Cause again, people don't realize when they go from,
 this is a small amount, then it goes up 10X.
 And so again, it's a bit like a computer game.
 Again, depending on the age of the audience.
 - So how much more I get with this?
 - Yeah, yeah.
 When you, nowadays, well, when there was a game
 called "Buddhakan", the way of karate
 and what would happen in this game is-
 - I remember this, hold on.
 - There was this great game,
 but this is like the 90s or early 2000s.
 - Danny, try and find a screenshot for me.
 - Oh, "Buddhakan".
 And B-U-D-O-K-A-N.
 - Is this like "Spectrum"?
 - It would be something like that.
 - BBC. - Yeah.
 It's sort of pre "Prince of Persia", sort of.
 But in that game, I remember buying this game,
 like rushing to buy this game.
 And it had this manual and the manual was like this thick.
 It was a book.
 It was like 80, 90 pages long and all these moves and so on.
 And you sort of read the first few pages
 and then you just gave it.
 - Yeah. - That's the one.
 - Oh my God.
 - "Buddhakan", the martial spirit, that's it.
 - Ah, yeah.
 - And I just remember that the manual
 was just like this tomb that you had to read.
 And it was probably one of the last ones in my mind
 of games where I read the manual
 'cause there was so many different moves.
 And now with modern games, what would happen is,
 but instead of giving you all of this book to read
 and then you play the game,
 the first few levels of the game were the instructions.
 And now there's either no instructions or just a pamphlet.
 And it's the same with modern electronics.
 They try to break it into the process.
 'Cause the understanding is that you've got,
 for people to educate people,
 you don't wanna tell them to go off to this separate thing,
 but you wanna bake it into the process.
 And so, and that's what leads to the best press
 and the best results.
 So a part of what we're doing is not just,
 it's to say we're thinking about it holistically.
 It's not just incredible.
 form of privacy, this form of decentralized custody.
 But it's also this vision of we're trying to deal with the problem end to end the way
 Apple and the iPhone tried to deal with the problem of people being able to communicate
 end to end.
 So it's not just the phone, it was the stores, it was the online app store as well.
 So we'll be looking at how do we get people to be hyper victimized, lightning Bitcoin
 and custody is part of it, as is the end of process of what are their daily lived in experience
 and need for money.
 So remittance, make that easy or to earn money, make that easy and so on.
 But also education and best practice, we think will be to bake that into the app as well.
 So there will be a time when you get above a certain value that it makes sense to self
 custody.
 And we shouldn't just be us, we think it makes sense in the app to start saying, well, maybe
 you should think about self custody, even helping them to get to that process.
 So yeah.
 I feel like you were trying to jump in a couple of times there.
 No, it should be louder man, just shut the fuck up Pete.
 I was just wondering if there's like a physical security issue where if the guardians have
 to be a or don't have to be but are largely public figures, and they say it's a three
 or five guardianship, you could use like Bitcoin podcast as an example.
 So it could be like Stefan, Peter, Matt O'Dell, Marty Bent, Daniel Prince, let's say you got
 a three of a five.
 Does a $5 wrench type become a $15 wrench type when one federation controls a fair amount
 of money?
 Are they, is there a physical threat to those people gardening it?
 Gardening?
 Not gardening.
 I like that.
 Gardening the property.
 I like that.
 Gardening the federation.
 So I guess it depends on the context.
 And it depends on, for example, if it's a regime that can be violent and so on, the
 risk is higher or lower.
 If you're already public figures, there's already a risk you're taking on because people
 are going to be aware that you're in the space and they're going to make assumptions anyway.
 One thing to remember is that guardians do not need to be physically connected with the
 community.
 They just have to be connected from a relationship point of view.
 So let's take the scenario where you have a family and some are in the diaspora and
 they're often sending money home to relatives abroad.
 And there's a village with many, many people who are the recipients.
 And that village might be in a place which is actually not necessarily safe to be a guardian.
 But the diaspora, members of the diaspora could be the guardians who are in New York
 and London.
 And they're often sending large parts of their paycheck back to the people back in the village.
 It's a very common scenario.
 So if they're already giving large parts of their money to the federation, to the village
 or to the relatives abroad, it seems that you could probably trust them to custody the
 money that they've been spending and giving as well.
 But also it means that their location is physically separate to where most of the money is being
 used.
 The other thing is because of the way of the sort of peer to peer nature of how federations
 are formed, outside of the federation, there's no reason for anyone else outside of the federation,
 unless you publicly announce that I've got this federation to ever know about it.
 Because a group of people who say, we want to set up a federation, the village will then
 say, okay, these people could be, again, they could be in the West, for example, because
 that's where they're working and earning, for example.
 They set up the federation or they could be in the same place.
 And then people will join on a person to person basis, scan their QR code, and they have sort
 of no incentive to tell anyone else that they're part of a federation.
 It looks like a wallet app, it acts like a wallet app on chain, it appears like a wallet.
 And you're getting benefits, it doesn't benefit you to tell people that you're using, it's
 a part of a federation or who the guardians are.
 Unless the guardians are making a fee, presumably.
 I mean, if they're making, why would that make you want to?
 Would they not want to incentivize more people to come in if they're making a fee?
 Potentially that's an interesting point, potentially.
 But as I said, my recommendation is to not charge a fee, it just makes things simpler.
 You're not earning any revenue from it, therefore you don't have to deal with tax issues and
 corporation tax and you reduce the risk of being considered a regulated activity, which
 would increase your overhead by a thousandfold.
 So probably dwarfing any revenue you make from that if you do take that route.
 Because making a commercial enterprise that's profitable is not an easy thing to do.
 But-- Especially in Bitcoin.
 Yeah.
 You always have the ability to, for example, a guardian might be an obvious candidate to
 have a lightning node that services the federation.
 And that can make money because it's a separate thing.
 And that lightning node doesn't need to be trusted by the federation.
 And so because it doesn't need to be trusted by the federation, it's much lower risk for
 that to be a profitable enterprise.
 And also, a federation could have multiple lightning nodes or federation members connect
 to multiple lightning nodes, so it leads to a competitive marketplace.
 So you don't need to-- but the creation of a productive Bitcoin community leads to multiple
 opportunities to generate revenue in other ways.
 I wonder how much chain analysis are looking at you guys thinking, hmm, what do we do about
 this?
 Well, they-- I mean, if and when-- not if, when--
 When, of course.
 --like federations, FedEmic federations are widespread.
 And we're talking about tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands of them.
 Within the federation, as I say, it's cryptographically near perfect privacy.
 There is-- you're severely limiting what can be done by an organization like chain analysis.
 So I don't know what they'll be thinking about it.
 Yeah.
 Talk to me about the privacy.
 Why is the privacy so good?
 Well, so if you take the example of the kiosk again, so that's clear, you know, mom and
 dad and children go off into this fairground, and each ride is like a merchant or service
 or whatever they're using it for.
 The exchange in that example, you probably imagine it's a clear piece of glass in front
 of the kiosk.
 But the innovation by David Chan was this thing called blinded signatures.
 And it's going to be described in many ways.
 But in this example, imagine that the kiosk window is painted over black.
 So all you have is the hole in the wall to pass through-- I had a weird thought there.
 I don't know where you're going with that.
 Hole in the wall to pass through the Bitcoin.
 OK.
 I think both of our heads were going there.
 That's also really wrong.
 But anyway--
 We're talking George Michael here.
 So yeah, anyway, yes, that's the fairground glory hole.
 But you--
 What the fuck is this?
 I thought you were--
 I know this is a cool information about privacy as well.
 The privy privacy.
 Anyway, so you--
 Glory holes offer pretty good privacy.
 Yeah.
 Privacy in the privy.
 So you go to this kiosk.
 You paint over the window.
 And you pass through your Bitcoin.
 And you get back these IOUs.
 Now--
 What do you owe me?
 So oh my days.
 I'm trying to keep a straight face here.
 I think I'm doing a--
 I won't look you in the eye.
 We're doing a good job.
 We're doing a good job.
 So you get back the IOUs.
 And effectively, you as the kiosk operator have no idea--
 Oh my days.
 You have no idea who you're giving the IOUs to.
 And so if you add to the fact that once they have the IOUs, they can do whatever they want
 within the fairgrounds.
 They can exchange tokens, pass it to other friends, et cetera.
 You can just intuit the fact that you basically have perfect privacy.
 You as the kiosk operator have no idea how many people are inside the fairgrounds, what
 they're transacting for, when you're providing change, who you're providing change for, when
 people are redeeming, who are people redeeming for.
 And so although it's a very simple idea conceptually, and the cryptography is 40 years, nearly 40
 years old, 1983.
 Yeah, it's like 39 years old.
 Conceptually it provides cryptography near perfect privacy.
 There is some-- you can still do potentially timing attacks and so on.
 You can also-- you will have different types of token.
 So you'll have $1 denomination tokens or 0.01 sets tokens, 0.1 sets tokens-- sorry, 0.01
 bitcoin or 10,000, 100,000 set tokens.
 So you would have an idea of how many of a given type you have.
 But that's across the entire user base.
 And that's why we say it's near perfect.
 Because for practical purposes, you don't want everybody to just walk around with tons
 and tons and tons of sets tokens.
 You need to have different denominations, just like normal cash.
 Yeah.
 I just stopped looking.
 We did well.
 I think we recovered it there at the end.
 I think so.
 I just hope my dad doesn't listen to that one.
 OK.
 By the way, congratulations on the raise.
 Was it 4.2?
 Yeah, 420.
 Nice.
 And it was 21 million post money valuation as well.
 We--
 The memes that you could just do what the fuck you want.
 Oh, we could do a lot.
 But also, there's tons of-- the site's designed to be very simple, but there's lots of little
 east eggs.
 Oh, man, get it up.
 No, but congratulations on that.
 That's pretty impressive.
 How are you guys going to-- intending on making money yourself?
 Is it just you charge people to use the wallet?
 Are you--
 It's the wallet.
 --transactional fees?
 So--
 Because wallets are hard to make money off sometimes.
 I know some are doing OK.
 Yeah.
 But-- so there's a lot of ways when you get-- I mean, our target is to get a billion users
 using this software.
 Wow.
 And my goal is to get that in a relatively short period of time.
 Tell me, come on, how long you can go?
 In a matter of a few years.
 And that's FediMint.
 Fedi is--
 OK.
 No, you can-- so both.
 Because FediMint is the protocol.
 It's good to see the two.
 And the protocol is this open source protocol.
 It's great because we have incredible support by the development community.
 What's the Fedi website?
 Fedi.
 F-E-D-I dot X-Y-Z.
 So but it's good to see both.
 So yeah, so this is Fedi.
 And this is for the wallet.
 And that's what I say, our focus is getting people off exchanges.
 And as people can't-- who want to be on exchanges, you can't even get on exchanges.
 And so that's where Fedi, powered by FediMint, helps.
 We got an incredible set of investors.
 One other I can't mention yet.
 But all Bitcoin only.
 And yeah, so this is it.
 But yeah, at the bottom, there's just little set of things.
 We say established, but we have a block height.
 And that block height--
 Do you know what?
 What's your block height?
 You know, like the football team.
 Get up our logo.
 So just like on the-- if you add it up, it's 7 plus 4 plus 5 plus 5 equals 21 as well.
 So you have to wait for that block.
 We wait for that.
 And also, when you go on the block, the amount sending is 21 million millisatoshis as well.
 And the change is 7 million millisatoshis, which is 21 million divided by 3, because
 the three founders.
 So do you like football?
 My team is QPR.
 Wow.
 So no.
 So obviously, all teams on their logo, they have the year they're established.
 We went for the block we established.
 And you waited for that block.
 Yeah.
 No, no, no, no.
 That block didn't matter.
 I just literally, when I did the registration, I went for it.
 We've also got-- I'll bring a shirt down to show you.
 We've also got running Bitcoin on the back of the shirt.
 You have these little--
 Yeah.
 It's amazing.
 Our first tweet on our tweet post was the block height.
 And we also add an op return on that block that says-- so if you go to the website just
 briefly, and I think if you click on that block, there's an op return.
 It has arrived.
 Yeah.
 So we also got the block at the time.
 And the amount is-- because we're thinking of the Lightning Network is 1,000 of a set.
 So it's 21 million millisats as well.
 So there's all this really cool stuff.
 How do you guarantee it gets into that block?
 We use a lock time.
 We use an end lock time so that it would come to the block after.
 You can't guarantee for sure, but--
 You'd be so pissed if it was a block afterwards.
 We would have still been playing.
 No, look, it's very cool, man.
 It's very cool.
 I like what you're doing.
 And I wish you all the best with this.
 It's very interesting.
 I love the buzz that's around it.
 I love the fact that it's a Bitcoin-only project.
 I love the fact that you're doing it.
 Your investors are fucking great.
 The ones I know of.
 It has to be Bitcoin-only.
 What's that?
 You're wearing their hat.
 Yes, yeah, 1031.
 Do you know what's so cool about this?
 Tell me.
 It's my birthday.
 Oh, really?
 Yeah, I was born on Halloween.
 Wow.
 So I've got the pumpkin up here on my--
 So you're destined to be involved with Bitcoin then?
 Well, I don't want to start any rumors.
 All right, tell people where to go.
 I mean, we've just had that, but tell people where to go to find out more.
 Who do you want to hear from?
 Yeah.
 So if you want to find out more, definitely go to--
