 All right, everybody, welcome. Welcome here to show 152. Matthew Majinskis here from the
 Baltics Latvia. World hockey bronze medalist very excited this Monday here and happy to
 have from Eastern US we have Alec Harris from Halo Privacy. What's going on? What's up,
 guys? Good to see you. Good to see you. We also have from France, our friend, Michelle
 from Nautil. What's going on, buddy? Hey, guys, what's up? And very happy to introduce
 our special guest today, Obi Nosu. He is from Fedi and working very hard to bring the good
 Fedimint protocol to the people. I had the good fortune of meeting him in Bedford last
 month and we figured it definitely would be good to get him on the show and talk Fedi
 and Fedimint. So, Obi, thanks a lot for joining and welcome. Thank you very much from
 Benfica winning Lisbon. Yes, should have said that. So it's great. Got a good European American
 contingency here. Representation from the global south as well. Yeah, just quickly with
 you, Obi, your story. You started CoinFloor long ago, if I recall. How did you first get
 into that business? So, I mean, I first got into Bitcoin in 2011. Friends told me about
 it because I was always complaining how the world was unfair and that meant the world
 lost out because we didn't have the best people in the best roles. So we're losing out on
 Einstein's and Tesla's wherever they may be. And I'm also a geek. I've been in, I studied
 computer science and cognitive science, popular now because of AI. And I was a CTO of a number
 of very successful European multi-country startups through late 1990s to the early,
 to the late noughties. So when they saw Bitcoin, they pointed me in its direction. Two or three
 people within a period of a few months. And I saw it and it's this world's first meritocratic
 money. I thought it was really interesting. I was still running my previous startup. I
 bought a bit and focused on my startup. When that closed and finished off in 2013, my soon
 to be co-founder asked me to sort of form a Bitcoin exchange. And I looked, Bitcoin
 was still growing. The small amount I'd put in, it'd be worth a significant amount more
 and decided to set up CoinFlow, but to do things that now seem common sense, but then
 were pretty groundbreaking, you know, be a well-run exchange as if we're going to be
 custodying other people's money, do it in a transparent, honest way, not try to trade
 against your own customers, you know, simple things like that. And that went on for eight
 years and I sold it at the end of 2021. And yeah, at one point we were 70% market share
 in the UK. The currency pair for Bitcoin to GBP was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
 We did the whole hitting the gavel and all that sort of good stuff. We gave advice to
 various people from this, you know, from MI5 to the police to Bank of England and so on.
 And we also had a subsidiary, which was one of the first regulated exchanges in mainland
 Europe as well. So lots of stuff, physically delivered futures as well. First in the world
 to do that. Unbroken record of provable solvency audits for eight years. So a few little caps
 to our name.
 Yeah. Kudos, man. Congrats to you for all of that. You're Nigerian by heritage, is that
 right?
 I would say Anglo-Gyrian. I was conceived in Nigeria, born in the UK. So I always like
 to imagine my mother made it to Heathrow Airport and I combat road downstairs into England
 because it was very soon after she arrived. And I'm like, "Okay, I'm here."
 Well, the only reason I ask, I mean, specifically about that and your Bitcoin story is I remember
 back in those days as well, like the concept of remittance and Bitcoin disrupting remittance
 was a big, always a big idea. You still have relatives in Nigeria. Was that for your inner
 circle? Was that part of it?
 I mean, even from before setting up CoinFloor in 2011 and 2013, I could see that there was
 a huge potential for Bitcoin in the global south, especially at that time I was focused
 on Africa and most sort of close to home was Nigeria. So the first, I used to make copious
 notes when I was a CEO of CoinFloor and my first page of my first notepad has this picture
 of Bitcoin, Nigeria, Naira, and this sort of circuit. How can I get Bitcoin to Nigeria,
 Naira, Nigeria, Naira to Bitcoin? It seemed like a massive opportunity. But I didn't have
 the ability to crack that at the time, partly because we were a UK focused exchange based
 in the city of London. Our investors were people from traditional finance and most of
 our revenue was from asset managers and high net worths and professional traders in UK
 and Europe. So it was very hard to convince people that the second market should be like,
 you know, West Africa or Latin. The second market was going to be Europe, maybe the US,
 but not. But at that time, for most people in the West, it wasn't clear that it was going
 to be worth the while to be in the global south. I think that's now resolutely changing.
 Everybody's going into the direction of realizing this is where there's a huge opportunity.
 Yeah, which is amazing. And definitely, I think we'll focus some time on that. But back
 to the coin floor and the idea of just the exchange versus when I was, I'm sure many,
 everybody has to go through this process when you're first buying Bitcoin. The way I was
 taught it was like, okay, buy Bitcoin, but you got to pull off the exchange immediately.
 I did it. Many people did that. But a lot of people didn't do that. What did you see
 with your customers? And was this a battle for you? I know that you are a fan of self
 custody. We can talk about how that relates to Fedimint, but just strictly with the exchange
 story. What was your experience?
 Yeah, with the exchange. It was very interesting. So I always say there was different phases
 of Bitcoin. It's the Gandhi, ignore, laugh that, then fought and then it wins. And for
 me, I came in at 2011. And from that point to 2013, around when we were starting, and
 just in the wake of Mt. Gox, it was basically ignored. But Mt. Gox brought it to people's
 attention and it was just ridiculed as how ridiculous could this thing be. But what happened
 was it made people and I always find the best educator for Bitcoin is nothing to do with
 Bitcoin. It's bad actors or it's overly, overly onerous regulation or global offense. They
 mass educate on a level that we can't compete with. And that happened with Mt. Gox. After
 that, everybody didn't need to be explained why you should take your money off exchanges.
 When you had your most users at that time after Mt. Gox would buy Bitcoin and instantly
 try to remove it. So it was just the norm. Now, as a reaction to that, exchanges like
 ourselves, although I'm proud of it, I also see it has had a weird, unexpected consequence.
 We tried to be much more trustworthy, much more transparent, much more organized and
 structured, which was a good thing. But the downside was that people then started to their
 natural distrust and a natural inclination to withdraw subsided over the following years,
 until it sort of did a 180 and people felt much more comfortable to the state where at
 least a few at least a year ago, where people felt much more comfortable holding their money
 on exchanges, then self custody. So we saw this weird transition. And so it became increasingly
 at the beginning, we didn't really need to think about it, people would just withdraw
 immediately. But later on, we had to put more and more effort into trying to get people
 to self custody. Now, many exchanges didn't do that because it's sort of, it goes against
 your incentives, wherever your custody is often where you trade. So you can play lip
 service to self custody, but you really want them to custody on the exchange. But in our
 case, again, you also want to list as many coins as possible. We bought the trend and
 state Bitcoin only, which still allowed us to be profitable, we could have made 100x
 more money if we didn't. We also bought the trend to really try to self custody, get people
 to self custody. And what we found was, after several years, when people now have had did
 this 180, they came to the view, especially as they became more and more mainstream as
 well, that they trusted exchanges more than they trusted themselves. And that became the
 sort of prevailing view. And people again, if they especially if they came from certain
 generations where they've grown up to be taught to trust institutions over yourself, and they
 would they would resonate with that viewpoint. So that was where we're at. And that was when
 that became increasingly apparent. That's why again, I became increasingly concerned
 with the end state. Because again, I always like to think forget where we are today and
 10% ahead of where we are today. What does the world look like when everybody if we want
 to if we want everybody is using it.
 And the end conclusion that sort of like in mid 2020s
 was we're gonna have a world,
 if you extrapolate wherever it happens,
 10 years, 50 years, five years,
 where you're gonna have one, two, three, four, 5%
 of people self-custodying
 and everybody else will be custodying
 on half a dozen exchanges.
 'Cause that's the other thing with exchanges,
 liquidity begets liquidity, they always centralize.
 And it was Mt. Gox, it was Poloniex,
 there's different ranges, Bitfinex for a time,
 but you always have one
 that has an outsized percentage of the volume.
 And so you're gonna have,
 forget about a country of half a billion people in it
 using a CBDC, you're gonna have exchanges,
 three or four or five,
 each one with a billion plus customers.
 And they'll have full insight with no oversight,
 which would be even worse than a nation state
 in terms of the level of visibility they would have
 if we allowed it to happen.
 So that was where we were by sort of the 20s,
 1920 and 2020, that was my view.
 - You mentioned having conversations with MI5 and police,
 and I'm sure you had to speak with regulators
 over the years.
 So is it your view that additional laws and regulations
 are needed for clarity, or is there an,
 and just speak to your experience, right,
 but is there enough already
 and we just need to operate within the existing rubric?
 - I think that there is enough clarity already,
 but my general view is that,
 and the clarity that's most important
 is the clarity around self custody or non-exchange custody.
 And more clarity will be beneficial,
 but the main thrust of that regulation is if you're,
 especially if you're fully custodying yourself,
 then you have, in most reasonable jurisdictions,
 you have the rights to determine who you interact with,
 you don't have to perform KYC on your counterparties
 and so on and so forth.
 And that's the regulation that I'm most concerned about.
 Now, if you are custodying on behalf of others,
 there are lots of areas of gray,
 that area is, can be made clearer in certain circumstances,
 but some of it is necessarily hard.
 You have forms of custody
 that haven't been possible before Bitcoin.
 So multiple people can have simultaneous ownership
 of the same asset at the same time.
 That wasn't possible before the existence of Bitcoin.
 So that's where you have some challenges
 and different jurisdictions treat it differently.
 Some will take the view,
 okay, well, if you don't have the ability
 to transact independently, then you're exempt.
 And others will say the same scenario you aren't.
 And so that's where there is complexity.
 - So how do you go from running a regulated exchange
 to FediMint?
 Can you maybe start by explaining really quick
 what FediMint is for our audience
 and then what led you to that project?
 - Okay, well, first FediMint is a protocol.
 So I'm not running FediMint.
 It's like the Lightning protocol or the Bitcoin protocol.
 Fedi is a company, which is a private organization
 that exists to accelerate adoption
 of Bitcoin Lightning and FediMint.
 'Cause we see when you take those three things combined,
 they allow you to scale the Bitcoin ecosystem
 to billions of users.
 The analogy would be FediMint would be cities,
 Lightning will be the motorways that connect the cities,
 and Bitcoin is the sort of foundation,
 the earth that they both sit upon.
 And that as an analogy scales to billions of users.
 One monolithic layer too,
 which is an approach that's commonly used
 that expected everybody to use
 would be the equivalent of one city
 where everybody in the world lives, for example.
 And everybody using the Lightning network
 and no cities would be the equivalent
 of everybody having their own private road
 connected to everybody else.
 Again, that doesn't scale.
 It's like the world would be all road.
 We see this model through the way our bodies works,
 through the way nature works, through the way cities works,
 through the way the internet works.
 We have IPv4, it cannot,
 we cannot have every person, every mobile and a phone
 having its own personal static IP address.
 The IPv4 doesn't support that,
 but we still have billions of users
 'cause we have something called
 network address translation
 where a few IP addresses are shared amongst an organization,
 a hosting provider, and so on,
 that allows IPv4 to scale to the world.
 We do the same, federations,
 think of them as cities or companies
 or organizations or communities.
 And at scale, Lightning works really well
 as this interconnection process, but not for every,
 again, you can have your own private road
 and it's very expensive and costly
 to have your own private road and mansion.
 You can have at scale your own Lightning connection.
 So that was the understanding that led to the realization
 that FediMint can help scale Bitcoin
 and the ecosystem to this global level of global adoption.
 The background to Fedi and FediMint,
 the protocol was actually a way of reducing the trust
 in this incredible protocol called Chami and Ecash,
 which is this private digital money protocol
 that was invented in 1983.
 This year it will be 40 years old.
 So it's very mature, very simple, very intuitive,
 but it required trust in one single institution,
 one bank, and also one money.
 And money at that time before Bitcoin
 could not be owned by multiple people.
 So if you couldn't own the money by multiple people,
 you might as well have one institution anyway.
 With the invention of Bitcoin and the idea of multi-sig,
 multiple people could take custody of or responsibility
 over the same money at the same point,
 even without having to be located physically
 in the same place.
 And that offered the opportunity then to federate,
 split up the bank as well.
 So if the money could be federated
 and the bank could be federated,
 which were the key prerequisites for Chami and Ecash,
 you could federate the Chami and Ecash Mint.
 And that's where FediMint came from.
 But what we realized is that it's Chami and Ecash
 and a federated Chami and Ecash was the first app.
 This is actually a protocol for taking any process
 that you may not want one person to have single control over
 and federating it.
 So you federate access to Bitcoin,
 that's Bitcoin multi-sig,
 federate access to the Lightning Network
 so that there's no one person who's controlling,
 processing transactions of the Lightning Network.
 And of course, Chami and Ecash.
 But we're now seeing people looking at federating
 any number of processes.
 So we did a hackathon where someone added support
 for federated Bitcoin backed stable coins and assets,
 federated community savings, federated password backup.
 Do I give all my passwords to LastPass so they can lose it?
 Or do I have my communities with no single point of trust
 with people I know handle my passwords?
 Anything that you think maybe it benefits
 from no single point of trust,
 I can run it in a federated manner,
 which is why we see FedEmit
 is almost like this federated operating system.
 It can run any application
 that you think should not have any single point of trust.
 But you also have these primitives
 of Ecash, Lightning, and Bitcoin always there
 and easily accessible by any of the applications
 you run on top of it.
 How did I transition to that from running CoinFloor?
 In 2020, I wrote a tweet, which I said,
 "2018 to 2023, Bitcoin was ignored."
 Sorry, "2008 to 2013, Bitcoin was ignored.
 "2013 to 2018, Bitcoin was ridiculed."
 'Cause I remember the first five years of running CoinFloor,
 we were literally laughed out of rooms
 in the city of London for this sort of joke,
 especially after Mt. Gox.
 It was basically ridiculed.
 And after the price peaked to around 2000 and it plummeted,
 most people, experts in the space,
 in traditional finance thought it was,
 that's it, it's gone, it's not coming back.
 But what people realize is that if Bitcoin doesn't die,
 that's how it wins.
 It just wins by not dying.
 And so it went down in value, it didn't die.
 And that's when people realize,
 okay, this thing doesn't die and it keeps growing.
 Now we have to take it seriously.
 And that's from, I think around 2018,
 when I catalog it, onwards was when the attack started.
 Now, Bitcoin is an idea and you can only attack,
 you can't attack an idea with missiles and guns.
 You attack it with misinformation
 and extremely onerous regulation.
 And that's what you started seeing in different quarters.
 And that's when I realized that it was sort of,
 the attack back began there.
 It didn't look like an attack for people who aren't looking,
 but that's when it began.
 And based on some of the stated timelines
 for delivery of certain things, CBDCs and so on,
 they all seem to be coincident with about 2023.
 So that's when I put a pin tweet in 2020,
 it was saying that Bitcoin will win in 2023.
 Why?
 Because the crescendo of the attack would be 2023.
 And so if we work together as a community,
 this would be the year,
 this would be the sort of Avengers end game point
 where it will be attacked most,
 it will potentially see significant volatility in its price,
 potentially downwards.
 But again, just like around 2018,
 when we saw things that fall and it didn't die,
 as long as it doesn't die, that's it, it's won.
 Because if the hardest attack has been attempted
 and it passes, then there's no more.
 attacks that can come. And that's what we're going to see this year, including very honest
 regulation from some of the biggest jurisdictions in the world, incredible levels of misinformation,
 and we will make it through that. Or we won't. You can't just sit back and it happens. But
 I have to believe that we will win that. But this will be the year where the attack happens.
 And we have the pieces, we have the base infrastructure, Bitcoin, we are seeing with
 alternative currencies, people are seeing the cracks starting to form, and they're going to
 become more and more obvious in the models of where there's perverse incentives, I can go into
 what those perverse incentives are. But that's, that's going to become that's becoming clearer
 and clearer this year. We're also seeing that lightning network can work at scale, if it's this
 interchange network. But it needs something else. If you want to scale to billions of users,
 a layer three, a bit on that. And now we have that layer three. And we have alternatives that
 people are working on as well. But we think FedEmint is a very viable layer three for
 much of the world. And so we now have the missing pieces. We have the funding, we have the
 the recognition, we have the attention on the Bitcoin community, if you look at what's happening
 in crypto, everything of interest, whoever is even the base and arguments and so on,
 is all between Bitcoin and Bitcoin. So it doesn't matter which side you choose.
 You're still choosing Bitcoin, nothing really interesting is happening anywhere else.
 So that's because attention is moving, whether it seems painful, it seems frustrating.
 But what you need to do is step back and where is the attention, nothing interesting is happening
 anywhere else other than Bitcoin. Whether you whether you agree once or the other, that's
 everybody should agree on that point. Good, you mentioned alternatives. I wanted to ask you,
 because I think Kalle mentions eCash a lot when he speaks about Cashew.
 How does FedEmint for the money aspect, at least compared to Cashew? Is it something which could
 be interoperable? Or is it completely unrelated and independent thing? Yeah, I think that the,
 I mean, Kalle is a really good, cool guy, and he's working on Cashew. But I think FedEmint is
 something very different. I mean, it's, eCash is one app. It's like saying that Microsoft Windows
 is Word or Excel, or saying that, you know, the iPhone is the phone app. It's much more than that.
 That's how we started. It was FedEmint was built as a solution to federate a Chaumian Mint. But we
 realized that the ability to federate any application and have this first class access to
 Bitcoin Lightning, and eCash, as these primitives that are available to you, is very powerful. It's
 a bit like you have an operating system, and you know, without having to worry that your operating
 system can run any application, so it's extensible, but it comes built in with support for
 file manager, i.e. storing information. The internet nowadays is now a standard part of any
 application, and the ability to execute other applications. So based on that, I can have app
 stores and so on, and each computer, although they can all run the same software, they don't.
 They pick and choose, and they run the application that makes sense to them. So in theory,
 we just did an announcement at Bitcoin Miami, and one of my co-founders, Justin Moon,
 showed the extensibility. We call them FedEmint modules. They're the equivalent of web apps on
 the millions of sites on the internet, or mobile apps on your mobile, or desktop applications on
 your desktop computer. We call them FedEmint modules. And one example was zCash. You could
 replace eCash with zCash, which is pretty private. It's very private, but if you're like a
 cryptographically puritan, it's not as private as eCash. But it has a benefit of allowing you to,
 as long as you trust zero-knowledge cryptography, to verify no issuance above the amount of assets
 that you're supposed to have. So you can externally verify lack of debasement, effectively.
 So you can have that trade-off. Or you could, if you wanted to, replace zCash or eCash with
 user accounts, and then you have no privacy at all, but you have full transparency. Which,
 for example, if your community is a company, you might think, well, the guardians for that
 community, because federations have guardians, trusted members of the community who actually
 run it, could be the finance department and the C-suite. In that case, they don't necessarily
 want the, they want full auditability in that case for the guardians. So you could replace that
 and put that in if that's what you wanted. If you wanted a different mechanism for
 transfers of value other than Lightning, you could add support for Liquid, or you could support both.
 It could run both of those FedEmit modules. And then you could have modules that do things
 as I said, a federated parser manager, a federated file system, a federated NOSTA server. So you're
 running NOSTA, but if it goes down, it doesn't, and anyone in that community that's using the
 federation has this sort of amortized cost shared across the communication. And it's also more
 reliable, because if one machine that goes down, you don't find all the users in that federation
 lose access to the service that NOSTA provides. So, and these are just some examples. We, there
 were, as I say, federated stability pools that allow you to have Bitcoin backed capital assets.
 So I can represent USD, gold, S&P 500, Tesla stocks, but actually behind the scenes Bitcoin.
 That's a pretty useful thing to do. And to do it in a way where there's no single point of trust.
 Once you've realized that it can run any application, but in without any single point
 of trust, then you're comparing an operating system to one application on one instance of
 one application. So that's why I'm saying that comparison. But in the e-cash application,
 which is one of already there's a half a dozen, and we hope there'll be thousands of these,
 the way they're implemented, they're logically equivalent.
 Can you talk a little about the mechanics, like how does a community form? And can you kind of
 just walk us through like, what's the process? Like, how do you start?
 So community is an input, not an output to us. So we always say that we combine the most
 fundamental human technology community with powerful, with empowering technologies. We say
 we're freedom technologies, like Bitcoin, like lightning, like Fedimint, and all the applications
 and modules and services that are built on top of it and connected to it. And we combine those
 together. And so, and the combination of the two is what levels up humanity. The way you should
 think about it is that right now we have in represented in the Bitcoin space, the concept that
 sometimes it makes sense that the institution of capitalist organizations, company, competition
 leads to great outcomes. We see that mining and many others. And we know that works. We can see
 from history that competition and commerce can drive innovation and progress. We also understand
 that self-reliance and learning to do things yourself and improve yourself and so on, also
 is a good use case and a good way of working. And we see that in the world as well. We know that
 it's good to become skilled at something and knowledgeable at something and level yourself up.
 But there's also another third thing that is very common in society, but we don't really see that
 represented not until Fedimint, which is the idea that humans can form communities. And we can have
 a situation where as a community, we are able to achieve things that no individual can do,
 but collaborative where it's a win-win. It's not competition, it's cooperation. So we don't
 really have this system right now represented how do we leverage the power, the superpower of
 cooperation to also level ourselves up. And this is the fundamental, one of the fundamental
 attributes of society. Cooperation is also really useful and it's not the same as competition. And
 it's not the same as self-reliance. All three have different use cases. And so Fedimint is basically
 taking the power of cooperation of community that already exists in communities around the world in
 whatever form, and then just providing them tools so we can supercharge what you already do.
 So you sometimes see this in other parts of the crypto space, but what they tend to do there is
 they say, well, we believe we understand how governance work and this is how it should work.
 And then you should follow that. We don't do that. If you're a company, 50 different companies will
 manage themselves slightly differently. And we're not going to say this is how you should run your
 company. If it works for you, it works for you. 500 different communities around the world,
 whether they be small local communities or geographically distributed virtual online
 communities will have different existing ways in which they make decisions and form,
 and they should already exist. But then they might want to work together to do certain things. If
 they want to, for example, save communally, right now, they're probably just doing some sort of very
 manual process where they're giving one person the money and so on. We can instead replace that
 with a Fedimint where they can share collaboratively, or they have certain costs, which
 they may be incurring individually, like for example, the cost to support a lightning node.
 Those costs could be amortized across the community.
 Also, if they lose information or so on,
 it's good to have other people that they collaborate with
 to help have each other's back.
 So for example, one of the FedEA modules
 is social backup and recovery.
 If I lose my keys, other members of the community
 can automatically, we can shard and encrypt
 and share with other members of the community
 so that I can automatically recover my keys
 in the event of loss.
 Again, that's something where collaboration
 works really powerfully to help that process,
 which right now is a challenge for a lot of people.
 What do I do with my backup?
 What you'll tend to find is whether you consciously aware
 of it or not, you will form,
 your solution will almost always form,
 have some sort of collaborative element.
 I might collaborate with my wife, my son,
 or a lawyer or a bank with a bank vault,
 but you're doing it as an ad hoc,
 expensive, inefficient way.
 If you realize that it's gonna require collaboration,
 you might as well actually make it a programmatic,
 efficient and simple way.
 If you just realize that collaboration
 is a very, very powerful technology
 and we should utilize that.
 - It's a beautiful vision.
 So like, let's say the four of us, right?
 Like just to bring it down to tangible,
 the four of us want to propose a use case, right?
 Like how do we do it?
 Like how do we organize?
 What is the, are we deciding on governance?
 What do we contribute?
 And say like the example of the password manager, right?
 So it's great that that recovery exists,
 but what is the mechanism to ensure
 that the recovery goes to the right place?
 Like only I can recover my passwords.
 - Yeah, so let's say social recovery of private keys
 for your e-cash.
 And in that situation,
 you, I'm assuming we're saying we're guardians.
 So again, a federation, a FedEmint federation
 is this community custody platform
 run by trusted members of the community, guardians.
 We'll be the four guardians in this case.
 And it has baked in Bitcoin lightning,
 privacy, extensibility and scalability.
 And it's run on behalf of the rest of the community.
 And let's say it's all the viewers of your show
 and that could be 50 million people, for example,
 but they won't be able,
 let's just say there's a thousand of them have joined.
 So yeah, for example, I have the app open here.
 For example, this is like a viewer, FedE alpha.
 It's like a viewer for a FedEmint federation.
 And just like Slack or others,
 you can connect to them.
 This is the federation that I'm connected to.
 But you notice I can add more federations
 and I can just, I don't know,
 without seeing what I'm doing, am I doing a good job?
 - Yeah.
 - I can scan another federation QR code
 and I can join multiple federations.
 So I can pick and choose which federations I'm a member of.
 I know the people who are the guardians,
 but the guardians don't necessarily know who I am.
 And I can decide on federation one,
 I store a certain amount of money and certain data
 and certain aspects of my digital lives.
 And the same for each other federation.
 So I, as the user can do that.
 And the person running the federation
 has no idea what other federations I'm a member of.
 So I segment my life in the way I want to do it.
 With each federation,
 I can allocate a certain amount of e-cash,
 which is basically think of it as FedE BTC,
 but it's still BTC, just like Lightning BTC
 and then MainChain BTC.
 And then one of the options is settings where I can click
 and I can choose to backup some information.
 Now, when I backup, I will say, backup my key
 and I can do the whole normal 12 word backup,
 which is a personal backup, or I can do social backup.
 And this entire process in social backup
 is a FedEmit module.
 It's an extension of functionality,
 just like an app on your mobile phone.
 So I click social backup here.
 It explains me a little bit,
 gives me a little bit of information,
 ask for camera access.
 And then it's asked me to make a,
 you can see this background,
 but I will make a recording now.
 And it says, hold the record button and say FedE.
 So I say FedE.
 And then what happens is,
 it asks me to confirm this video.
 FedE.
 Now, what I've, now, then I say backup.
 Now, what happens here is a ton of stuff.
 And it's a ton of stuff,
 which if you go to one of these guides on best practice
 of how to backup your private keys
 in the absolute best practice way,
 it's just done it all.
 Normally, if you're trying to do it yourself manually,
 you'd take a while to do this,
 like several days and a lot of money.
 So what has happened here?
 First of all, it's,
 you first thing you have to do is locate
 who is going to hold your backup for you.
 Well, you've got the guardians already.
 We're running the servers.
 We're, you're, you know, having conversations,
 recording a podcast,
 but your machines are running,
 like your Bitcoin note is running.
 So it's actually the machines that are the guardians.
 You're just guarding the machines.
 You don't have to interact with that process at all
 'cause they're running these FedEmit modules
 and this is one of them.
 And so what happens just there on my phone,
 I take my private keys, I encrypt them first.
 Then I split it up 'cause there's four guardians
 into four cryptographic chunks.
 Yeah, so that it only requires any three of those
 to recompile.
 It's called Shamir's secret sharing scheme,
 but it splits it up.
 Then before it sends them to the guardians to store,
 and they're waiting to store it automatically,
 the guardians servers or FedEmit servers,
 it needs a way for you to be able to identify the person,
 but we don't want to provide any information
 to the guardians.
 So what we do is we take that video and we hash the video
 and we use the hash of that video
 to tag each one of those shards.
 And then we send the hash tagged, encrypted, sharded chunks
 to the users.
 Now that's the best practice.
 Most people don't do any of that.
 And they don't share it with multiple people,
 they share it with one person.
 That all happened in a few seconds.
 So you're left with the video of yourself saying FedE,
 just that, and a private key to encrypt.
 Then we combine those two together.
 Again, this is all the FedEmit module doing this,
 combine it together into a file on your phone.
 And now that file on my phone, I should save.
 I just need to save that anywhere.
 I'm just gonna save it to send it to myself on WhatsApp.
 And then I've sent it to myself on WhatsApp
 and I click, good, done.
 And then it says, do you wanna save it again?
 I can save it again and I can choose somewhere else.
 Save as many times as I want.
 As long as you don't save it, you can give it to a friend.
 As long as they're not one of the four guardians,
 anyone else of the other 8 billion people
 on the planet would be fine.
 Because to recover, that doesn't actually contain my,
 it's not like an encryption of your actual private keys.
 It's an encryption of the key
 to find the private keys and recover it.
 So if to recover, someone will have to go
 back to the Federation and there's a similar process
 to recover where you upload the file to a new machine phone.
 It will then generate a QR code and say,
 get three of the four of you guys to scan this QR code.
 And if you can get three of the four to scan the QR code
 from this phone, then they will send you back the shards.
 But in order to do that, I have to walk up to you,
 especially if you're in an AI world,
 I would recommend walking up to them,
 but, or do it over a video call like this.
 But it's really hard to show someone a QR code
 over a video call and not show your face
 and not be really, really, really suspicious.
 So you have to show your face and all the video
 at the point of scanning the QR code,
 at that point, again, automatically
 the FediMint module will handle this.
 You will only then will your phone send
 just the video through with you saying Fedi.
 But what have you revealed there?
 You revealed your face and your voice
 saying the word Fedi, which is not identifiable in any way.
 And you're on a video call with the person.
 So you've only revealed what you've already revealed
 by being on a video call.
 You haven't actually, you're using the Fedi app.
 So it's implicit that you're using the Fedi app
 and your face is on the video call or you're in person.
 So you haven't actually revealed any additional information
 and the only at the time you need to recover.
 Now, if someone else, one of your friends tried that,
 they would have to look and sound
 and have the mannerisms of you.
 And if they're part of your community,
 if you're using the power of your community,
 it's not a stranger and an underpaid overworked guy
 in working for a curly haired guy in the Bahamas,
 which we know doesn't end well.
 But it's actually someone who's part of your community.
 Even if they're part of the extended community,
 they've probably seen you around
 and you need to get three or four of them
 to recognize not just a low quality passport photo,
 but your face and your voice,
 still not knowing your name or address
 or where you're about, just your face and your voice.
 I would go with that one any day over one person
 and a grainy passport photo who doesn't know me
 and doesn't care about me.
 So that's, but that whole thing,
 that whole interaction is one FedeMint module.
 So that's why comparing, you know,
 and this is why the idea started with this
 and it was invented by one of my co-founders, Eric,
 and it was a solution to how to federate the Chowmeer Mint.
 But the solution to do that is way more powerful than that.
 Of course, we, as standard,
 we always think you should have best in class privacy,
 that's e-cash, but you can swap it out for less,
 but we start with the best.
 You know, my father used to say,
 "Vel Primus, Vel Cum Primus."
 Either the best or among the best.
 So we start with the best,
 but you can then swap it out for Zcash,
 which is sort of 90% there,
 or you can just go for user counts if you want.
 And Bitcoin, I really don't think there's any point
 to have any second best when it comes to.
 There is no second best on that, but you can,
 but if you're worried about scalability and so on,
 Bitcoin, FediMint and Lightning
 give you all the scalability you need.
 So Bitcoin, and then Lightning Network,
 which is highly reliable.
 It's this interchange networking protocol for value,
 which is older than most other cryptocurrencies.
 And it's shown to be incredibly reliable
 and well supported and ever better supported.
 So we can add more,
 and if something else comes out that's better,
 we can just add support for it.
 But in a way where there's no single point of trust.
 So there's no net benefit, net loss for us to add support
 for any new protocol that comes about.
 And that's what people need to understand.
 It's not one thing.
 This is a platform for the base of this,
 in combination with Bitcoin as a foundation
 and Lightning for interconnecting,
 or any other alternative interconnection platform
 that can support billions of users
 in billions of use cases.
 - That was super helpful.
 Yeah, thanks man.
 - The only other thing I would say on that
 was when you've positioned it, how could we present that?
 That could imply another use case,
 which is I'm a developer or an engineer
 and I've got this incredible idea,
 and I wanna be able to roll it out to these communities.
 How do I do that?
 'Cause, and in that case, you just develop it, build it.
 You can host something simply with,
 as a Lightning enabled website, a WebLN enabled website,
 and it can integrate seamlessly within.
 So for example, as again,
 one of the modules that we have access to
 is a Lightning module,
 and that allows us to access
 the whole of the Lightning network.
 So for example, this is running on a test net,
 but we can allow you to get sats,
 but this web browser is running within the app.
 Why is that powerful?
 Because I can, for example, send myself sats,
 and it recognizes instead of generating a QR code,
 which I then have to copy and paste
 and scan into a separate app,
 because the app that supports the wallet
 is also the app that supports the browser,
 I can recognize that and then just replace that
 and just say, hey,
 this person wants to send you 10,000 sats,
 and I can just click accept,
 and you can see here, it's just basically,
 in this case, it's Signet coins.
 It mines the coins in live,
 but it's just there.
 It's just sent me 10,000 sats,
 and I didn't need to,
 and then I close this browser,
 'cause I'm still in the browser,
 and I look, and my balance has gone up by 10,000 sats,
 and you can, with the main chain versus
 that we're playing around internally,
 I can go to a site like Stack and Use,
 click a button to log in over Lightning,
 and it says, Stack and Use would like you to log in.
 Do you want to log in?
 You click yes, and it just sends a,
 effectively a zero value Lightning transaction,
 and I have one click login without revealing my ID,
 and then I can deposit money to upvote a story,
 and if I've sent too much money,
 I can click to refund and receive it,
 never having to scan a QR code.
 Again, because that's a different module.
 The Lightning module allows that to seamlessly happen,
 plus the e-cash module,
 and so I can create all of these sites and enable them
 and make the experience as seamless as an app experience.
 Later on, I think, I don't want my hosting costs,
 so I can package my whole site up
 and make it deployable on Federation,
 so the Federations run the sites,
 and the Federations can choose to run it
 for their own communities,
 and if they run the sites on their own communities,
 they can allow it to have access to more,
 instead of just high level and Lightning payments in and out.
 If I've got additional FedEvent modules,
 for example, community savings and so on,
 I can create an app which runs on a Federation,
 which accesses those additional lower level features,
 so you can now build,
 without having the hosting costs as a developer,
 I can build apps, just like I can build on top of,
 like on Windows or a Mac or an iPhone.
 I can build on top of Federations,
 without having to host,
 but still receiving a stream of revenue
 whenever they use my app.
 - Yeah, it's really interesting.
 I mean, so many different directions we can go,
 in the interest of time.
 Just wanna ask, one thing I'm hearing now,
 which I didn't quite make the connection before,
 is all the additional modules and federated apps
 that you can do besides the e-cash,
 but still that was my impression
 that that was kind of the core of FedEvent,
 was it was to scale payments and to scale finance,
 to scale banking in a community federated manner,
 which is great.
 It's like fiduciary media and free banking,
 which I'm a huge fan of,
 but it's in a free way.
 And with e-cash that's completely federated
 and can be anonymous,
 much more anonymous than Bitcoin itself.
 So I know this is hard to predict,
 but I guess my question is,
 do you see FedEvent as a basis
 for a huge global ecosystem of federated apps,
 or versus just that sort of core banking function?
 - I think it's one of the same,
 because if we look,
 you have this highly centralized internet right now,
 where there's one or two very large companies
 getting larger all the time.
 And I think we have to be concerned about big tech
 more than big company,
 'cause they have incredible amounts of power,
 even the most minimal level of oversight, they have none.
 So that's in my way more worrying.
 But to replace that,
 we as a community are trying to form
 this sort of decentralized alternative
 where you have things like Nostar,
 IPFS for data storage,
 Bitcoin of course, Lightning, et cetera.
 But for that to work and be a viable alternative,
 even in future, I can imagine decentralized,
 federated AI and so on and so forth,
 these apps will need a new funding model,
 'cause the funding model of the centralized world
 has been advertising.
 You're the product,
 and then they effectively sell it to advertising
 and it's all free apparently,
 but you're paying in a different way.
 So what is the alternative?
 It has to be for it to work,
 'cause advertising only works at scale,
 is it has to be, you have to pay for the usage.
 So if I want to use, make a query to AI,
 you're noticing they're charging for it
 because it's sort of obviates the need for advertising.
 'Cause I can give you the answer to your question.
 So I've stopped making sense.
 So you're seeing average revenue based on usage.
 You're seeing that on Nostar,
 you can get a free level of usage,
 but if you actually want a good quality of service,
 you have to start paying for Nostar relays,
 which is great because you're seeing the first signs
 of people understanding that if I want more control
 and of my money and my data and my digital lives,
 I'm gonna have to just pay for as I go for the usage.
 Well, that means the increase of the centralized world
 equals an increase of transactions
 and of lightening transactions of interchange, et cetera.
 But we wanna make that scalable.
 You need to be able to send transactions
 at near zero costs and at scale again,
 you're gonna see a lot of that being
 e-cash transactions happening internal to federations.
 And now, and again, you're going to have these balances
 going between federations over the motorway.
 But just like in most cities,
 most economic activities within cities,
 and then there's this transfer between cities.
 So they are one and the same.
 If we have a future, which is more decentralized,
 then we must have a requisite increase
 in Bitcoin transactions, lightning transactions,
 and inter-federation transactions,
 which are e-cash transactions.
 And also the power, but once you do that,
 you realize that the power of that allows you
 to no longer have to know who you're transacting with.
 So you should, by default, offer people
 the highest level of privacy that they can expect
 without reducing functionality.
 And there's no functionality loss
 when you're just charging for the service,
 because then I can say, well, I'm delivering a service.
 It's near zero costs, especially within inter-federation.
 So I can just do pay as you use, I can stream money.
 And therefore I don't need the various information
 that you would normally need in a world
 where it's based on advertising, et cetera,
 where the advertiser wants to be able to locate
 and contact the person afterwards
 that they've spent money with the service provider on.
 - Speaking of monetization,
 first congrats for your recent raise.
 I'm curious to understand,
 how do you monetize the Fedi company itself?
 - Fedi company, it's quite simple.
 Fedi, the actual app, or the actual service, the software,
 Fedi Alpha is a pay as you use service.
 So if we facilitate a transaction using the Fedi Alpha,
 it charges a very, very small few basis points fee.
 Not in Alpha, but when we go to full production, we will.
 And that covers the overheads of the company
 and allows us to reinvest,
 reinvest in the open source ecosystem,
 reinvest in building, not just on Fedimint,
 but also on Lightning and on Bitcoin,
 'cause we're in aligned and it's an aligned revenue model
 because it doesn't really matter to us
 how people are using it,
 as long as we will continue to earn no matter what.
 So we then can support anybody, anywhere
 that's delivering value to the communities they have.
 And a really big part of us as well is that we,
 a big part of the raise is that we go around
 and we are looking to hire hundreds.
 In fact, we were targeting up by the end of 2026, over 500.
 FedEye Masters, FedEye Knights, and FedEye Ambassadors.
 This is sort of this on the ground evangelism,
 education, and support service.
 Think of it like this decentralized genius bar
 for the world.
 And so normally an app is here's a piece of software
 and you figure it out yourself.
 But if you're getting, again, to 8 billion users,
 you have to think about models that have got right down
 to the most, the least sophisticated users,
 and have been comfortable with very high technology.
 And a clear example of that is Apple.
 So, but we're like, we want to take that model
 but be the Apple for everybody.
 So that's our approach.
 It also means that most developers
 tend to be developer heavy, business development light.
 As an organization, we're going to be
 business development heavy, development developer,
 still heavy actually, but business development heavy.
 So that as this platform, if you build on us,
 just like if you add yourself to the app store
 on your iPhone, we effectively can help drive adoption
 of good products that actually solve problems
 for communities.
 We can drive adoption into those communities
 and you gain the benefit.
 We become your business development arm,
 the outsource business development arm for your company.
 But instead of charging 30%, it'll be,
 we don't actually charge anything
 because our fees or a tiny fraction of that
 because our fees come from just more signal usage
 of our app equals more revenue for us.
 - It's a great view.
 I mean, I remember we met at a Human Rights Foundation
 last year.
 Are you going there again this year?
 - Yes. - In June?
 - Yeah, definitely, yeah.
 - I mean, that, you know, going back to,
 we talked about at the beginning,
 like with remittances and kind of a lot
 of the original views of Bitcoin for everyone,
 something like this just truly seems
 like it really could change the game
 and really help it scale.
 Do you guys have, you know, everybody likes to stay away
 from the word roadmap in this decentralized
 development space, but do you have a vision of,
 I mean, I know you said how you wanna sort of build it,
 but do you have a vision of--
 - Yeah, we do.
 - Communities that you'd like to see
 in the next five years?
 - So we have three communities.
 Fede as the company exists because of also Freedom Forum
 and where we met some incredible human rights defenders,
 activists, NGOs, working in some of the toughest parts
 of the world, parts of the world which are under the yoke
 of authoritarian regimes with dictatorships,
 which is more than half the planet.
 And we realized that they do have a superpower
 in those communities, their ability to collaborate
 and cooperate with each other, and they have to to survive.
 So Fede fits perfectly into those.
 And we've been fortunate enough to build
 really strong relationships with members of,
 or activists and human rights defenders, et cetera.
 So we are already trialing in many of those sort of zones
 and challenging areas.
 And again, this represents billions of people
 and the communities that they support and serve
 are numbered in the hundreds of thousands to millions.
 So we are working with those already.
 And that was always our commitment.
 That was our first market.
 The next is the global South again.
 So the first is people who have banking potentially,
 but can't trust the banking.
 If I send money from the wrong accounts
 to my account in Belarus, I get arrested or shot.
 So there's banks that are great there,
 but I just can't use them 'cause I can't,
 'cause it's dangerous for me to use them.
 Then the second group is people who don't have
 what we would consider reasonable services
 or they're unbanked or underbanked.
 It's the global South.
 And again, the first in rows into that are Bitcoiners
 who really love Bitcoin and care about it,
 but they also love a certain community.
 And there's a few million of those on our waiting list
 who want to, in terms of the number of people
 that they represent, few hundred,
 but number of people they represent is a few million.
 And you'll know some of the names like Bitcoin Lake,
 Bitcoin Akasi and so on.
 Again, we're working with these.
 That's the second group.
 So we're gonna work with,
 those groups will take us a few years to work through,
 but we're starting already with them
 and we will work with them through the background.
 Near the end of this year, we've just released Fedi Alpha,
 which is the first version of Fedi
 that people can see and play with,
 but it's Signet, well, there's a federation
 that we've also set up, which is Signet Bitcoin,
 not real Bitcoin, but it still operates like Bitcoin.
 And you can see the power of it.
 And we're focused at developers and builders
 to build Fedi modules, Fedi apps from around the world,
 ideally close to where the problems they are.
 So if it's in the West and they see problems in the West,
 whatever that may be, then they can build apps for that.
 If they're in the global South, they can build apps for that.
 They can build apps for anybody, anywhere,
 but we think as long as you make it really easy
 for people to build functionality, which we will be doing,
 we'll be making more announcements
 over the coming couple of months to build,
 then people should be able to build anywhere in the world
 for the problems they see locally.
 And we expect to see use cases come from that.
 By the end of this year or before the end of this year,
 we want to roll out a full production version,
 ideally with a marketplace of, or not a marketplace,
 but a universe of Fedimint modules and so on
 that support various things.
 If it's integrating with SAP,
 'cause if the companies or Sage on one side
 and another go outside,
 it's adding community banking or so on.
 We're building that over the coming months
 and then we will roll out once we have
 that requisite feedback and experience
 and this sort of list of apps.
 So we then we roll out to the full version of Fedi then.
 In parallel, we're hiring our,
 I'm giving you a lot of information here,
 but we're hiring our FedEye order.
 We've already made, we're making very good progress there.
 And over the coming years, we're looking to hire,
 I said, hundreds of these,
 predominantly in the global South
 or people living under the reoccur of authoritarian regimes
 and dictatorships.
 'Cause in the West, there's already an abundance
 of really great podcasts and speakers.
 So we don't need to do effort to explain the concept
 or the existence of this,
 but areas where people are not thinking about Bitcoin,
 they're not thinking about lightning,
 they're thinking about, I need to survive
 or I need a way to help give money to this person.
 That's where we're hiring the people on the ground.
 The end result and aim is for us,
 we set a target by the end of 2026
 to have 1 billion people using FedEye.
 And that seems like a lot,
 but it's actually when you break it down by communities
 and based on our average community size
 from our initial numbers,
 the first few hundred communities who have signed up,
 you're talking about the mid-teens thousands
 is the average community size we're seeing.
 So you're talking about 100,000 or so communities
 to get to that sort of number.
 And 100,000 communities with 500 or so nights between them
 works out to be a few communities a year per night.
 So when you roll out a community at a time,
 it's way more powerful than trying to roll out
 to 8 billion individuals over time.
 - Fascinating.
 Whose idea was the FedEye night, FedEye order?
 - I can't say, but my name is Obi,
 but I'm not gonna say whose idea it was.
 It was all a happy accident.
 The name FedEye,
 we raised our first round after coming back from Oslo.
 We started fundraising and we received all of the offers
 for the first raise, 4.2 million in six and a half days.
 And we didn't actually have the name of the company
 at the time, but we'd already got the commitments.
 And so we had some other names like FedEyemint Labs.
 And then luckily one of the human rights defenders,
 actually, Leopoldo Lopez mentioned that FedEyemint
 is difficult for people in Latin America to pronounce
 just the way the word works.
 And then so you observed and the words tend to end in vowels
 and wanted to keep it simple.
 So why don't we just go for FedEy?
 And we checked and it seemed okay.
 There didn't seem to be these big conflicts
 and issues with it.
 And so we went, but then after a while,
 that was considered, it just really stuck
 and it's a really, really nice, simple name.
 And then you notice that it has similarities
 with another word.
 And so that's what inspired us for some of the names
 of the FedEy order, I would say.
 - Wow, that's amazing.
 That would be really interesting stuff.
 Thanks a lot for sharing this.
 Listen, as we close it, where can our listeners
 and viewers learn a little bit more?
 - So to find out, best place to start is FedEy.
 FedEy.xyz is the website.
 If you're a builder, you can go there and find out
 how to start building on FedEy Mint.
 And we all have links to FedEy Mint and so on,
 or building FedEy mods.
 Or if you want to try and play around with it,
 you can see and understand the mission and vision and team.
 That's the best.
 For me personally, you can see it here.
 I'm showing my age, but I'm one of the three letters
 on Twitter, so OBI on Twitter.
 Or you can also get me on,
 you can get me on Nostra as well.
 - Fantastic.
 Listen, OBI, thanks a lot.
 Really, really interesting stuff.
 All the best to you guys.
 And yeah, it was a pleasure talking with you.
 - Yeah, thanks man.
 - Fascinating stuff, thank you very much.
 - Thanks very much.
