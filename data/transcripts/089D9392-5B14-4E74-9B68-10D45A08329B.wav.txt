 Good morning, everyone.
 A little bit under the weather today with a cold,
 so I'm gonna try and just get through this one.
 I've been meaning to chat about Fedimint for a while,
 and after receiving an email
 from Ego Death Capital this morning
 about their investment toward Fedimint,
 it has prompted me to finally do so.
 Despite nonstop attempts by the Bitcoin community
 to help educate the wider community
 on the importance of self-custody,
 quote, "Not your keys, not your coins,"
 the unfortunate reality is that a dominant percentage
 of users relinquish custody of their keys
 to third-party exchanges,
 and this weakens not only the security
 of the holdings of the individual,
 but the entire network significantly.
 The primary reasons for this are,
 one, people lack the technical competence to do so,
 two, cost, many people around the world
 simply cannot afford the price of a hardware.
 wallet. And three, many people prefer to outsource that trust, as they do not trust themselves to
 take responsibility and secure their Bitcoin. This basically turns any exchange into a massive
 honeypot for government and nefarious actors wishing to control, surveil, restrict, and censor
 the use of these Bitcoin, and could even lead to mass seizure of Bitcoin, similar to what happened
 in 1933 with gold following executive order 6102. Fundamentally, this dynamic removes the censorship
 nature intended due to the outsourcing of trust to custody one's Bitcoin keys.
 Federmint, short for Federated Charmium Mint, is a protocol that has the potential to profoundly
 improve Bitcoin self-custody solutions, and offers to potentially solve one of the most significant
 attack vectors facing Bitcoin today. That being large percentages of Bitcoin keys being
 custodied by centralized third party exchanges.
 Federmint leverages two primary technologies
 being one, federations or community shared wallets.
 This can be simply thought of as multi-signature wallets
 and two, the use of Charmian Mints.
 Attached is a great blog post explaining more
 around the use of federated mints,
 including how and why they could improve scaling
 and privacy on Bitcoin.
 Charmian Mints are explained in the post as follows,
 quote, "Charmian Mints, also known as Charmian Banks
 or Blind Mints, offer a compelling solution
 to these problems, particularly when operation is federated.
 Charmian Mints, through the use of blind signatures,
 have extremely appealing privacy properties.
 The mint operators do not know the number of users,
 their identities, account balances, or transactions."
 transactions histories. Additionally, Mint transactions are cheap and can be performed
 at unlimited scale."
 Federmint could offer a superior custody model while maintaining Bitcoin's core properties,
 and without sacrificing decentralization. The three primary benefits to leveraging this
 technology are 1. A superior Bitcoin custody solution, better than trusting an unknown
 third party like an exchange, and perhaps even better than individual self-custody due
 to the fail-safes it would provide. Federmint has the potential to be a superior way to
 self-custody Bitcoin, which would be widely available to all users.
 2. Privacy. Federmint can dramatically improve privacy on Bitcoin as the use of federated
 Chummy and Mints makes it impossible for chain surveillance companies to tell the difference
 between a normal transaction and that of a Federmint.
 Federation. While they would be able to see the total balance, they cannot know who is
 sending or receiving what, and the balances of individual Federation members is completely
 hidden.
 3. Help more people take ownership of their Bitcoin and enable them to leverage the core
 properties offered by the protocol, like censorship resistance, that are lost when trusting centralized
 third-party exchanges. The forming of Federations outsources the most technical parts of self-custody
 from the individual user who may not have the technical competence to do so, to trusted
 members of the Federation. Thus making it far more possible than before for these users
 to custody their Bitcoin keys.
 Below is a timestamped link to Obi Nwosu's presentation on Federmint at Bitcoin 2022
 where he goes through the ins and outs of the protocol which I highly recommend watching
 to understand more.
 In my opinion, the improvement of privacy on Bitcoin is the single most important advancement
 as fundamentally everything else is downstream of privacy.
 The priority to ensure user privacy cannot be overstated.
 The need for it to be standard procedure is critical.
 This requires an alternative to solve for the vast number of Bitcoin users giving custody
 of their private keys to centralized third-party exchanges.
 It must be simple for any user, regardless of technical capability, to utilize and implemented
 in a way that makes it robust and commonplace when interacting with the network.
 And in my opinion, the promise of Bitcoin fulfilling the mission to separate money and
 state relies on such a solution.
 Hopefully Fedimintis that solution.
 Time will tell.
 Just another example of why open networks win.
 Open source everything.
 Hope you have a great day.
 I'll talk to everyone tomorrow.
