 This is Matthew Krader from Bitcoin University,
 and today I wanted to talk about how
 Bitcoin scales, in this case using a new protocol called
 Fediment.
 So as we all know, the Bitcoin base layer
 can only handle about seven transactions per second,
 seven TPS.
 This isn't too bad, especially since that's
 comparable to Fedwire, which is about nine transactions
 per second.
 And this is one of the trade-offs
 that Satoshi made in order to ensure that Bitcoin could
 be a decentralized, secure, and neutral base
 layer for global money.
 If you make your money highly centralized, like PayPal,
 you can also make it really, really fast.
 But then you have to deal with the censorship and control that
 comes from centralization and control
 and capture by a few insiders.
 So with such slow TPS, transactions per second,
 how exactly does Bitcoin expect to scale to billions
 of people using it?
 Well, one way that Bitcoin scales
 is by having each transaction on the base layer
 secure more value.
 So back in 2012, an average single transaction
 on the Bitcoin blockchain might secure $5, in other words,
 one Bitcoin worth of value.
 In 2032, an average single transaction
 might secure $5 million, one Bitcoin of value.
 Bitcoin also scales through faster, cheaper, more private
 layer 2 solutions, like the Lightning Network.
 And I'll link to this video in the description notes
 below if you want to learn more about Lightning.
 But today, we're going to talk about another scaling
 solution called Fetiment.
 Fetiment is an open source protocol
 that allows people to create federated Chami and Mints
 on Bitcoin, and more on that in a minute.
 Feti itself is a private company building a software product
 using this open protocol called Fetiment.
 So we have Fetiment and Feti, the private company.
 I think this is actually a really, really big deal.
 And I haven't been as excited about a new protocol
 in a really long time.
 So here's how it works.
 If you use the company Feti software,
 this allows you to set up a quote unquote "federation,"
 which is controlled by trusted members of your own community,
 which are called guardians.
 Or you can use the open source Fetiment protocol for free
 and write your own software that does this.
 So this is the option.
 And this will create a lot of competition,
 which is good for the consumer.
 So you set up a federation controlled by trusted members
 of your community.
 The community in question might be a large extended family,
 a village, a tribe, a club, a neighborhood,
 an online community, a Bitcoin conference, for example,
 as we're going to see.
 And the guardians of this federation that you set up
 will be people from the community that you already
 know and that you are probably already trusting
 with growing your food, babysitting your kids,
 watching your house when you travel.
 If any of you are holding Bitcoin
 for less tech savvy members of your family,
 for the very young or the very old,
 you can understand how this might work.
 So these guardians of the federation
 are also signers of an M of N multi-sig setup.
 So for example, you need 7 out of 10 village elders,
 if they're the guardians of your federation,
 to sign a Bitcoin transaction to move the money.
 One way of thinking of federations
 is as an online space where members
 can use their smartphones to message each other,
 to send each other money, store sensitive individual
 or community data in an encrypted manner.
 But rather than trusting Brian Armstrong of Coinbase
 or Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX to hold your Bitcoin,
 you're trusting people that you already know
 and trust in real life.
 And if they steal from you or do something wrong,
 they will be ostracized from the community
 and lose access and lose social capital.
 So that's a strong incentive against bad behavior,
 along with the multi-sig setup,
 which means that multiple guardians
 would need to collude to hurt you.

 I just ask you to hit that subscribe button.
 That would really help out the channel and its reach.
 So let's say that you join your local village federation
 by simply, you download the Fetty app on your phone,
 you scan a QR code invitation from your community,
 and then you are part of the federation.
 You may also choose to send in, let's say, 100,000 sats.
 One Bitcoin is comprised of 100 million sats,
 so 100,000 sats is about $30 today.
 and then what happens to those SATs or Satoshis is they immediately get secured by the emulsion.
 to six set up on chain, and then the federation issues you e-cash, which is also denominated
 in Sats or Satoshis that you can use to pay people inside of the federation.
 So now you can use that e-cash to pay the local butcher, the local farmer, the artist,
 or a family member who are also part of the federation.
 And these e-cash payments within the federation are basically free and instant.
 At some point, Feddy may charge a couple of basis points, as I understand it, per transaction,
 but it'll still be very, very low transaction fees, much lower than we have certainly with
 credit cards these days.
 And here's another amazing thing.
 If your phone happens to be offline, you can still pay people successfully using this e-cash
 since Chami and e-cash is a bearer asset, and you can just hold it on your phone and
 use it without needing an internet connection.
 So that's one answer to people who wonder how Bitcoin might work if the local internet
 is down.
 Now it's important to note that this e-cash within the federation is not an altcoin.
 It is a version of Bitcoin, and it can at all times be cryptographically proven to be
 fully backed by real Bitcoin that is being held in that multi-sig address by the federation.
 And anytime you want, you can ask the guardians to convert your unspent e-cash back into Sats
 and then withdraw it to self-custody, either through an on-chain payment using the base
 layer of Bitcoin or using the Lightning network.
 Now try to imagine a world of thousands of federations, maybe even millions of federations,
 different communities, each linked to each other using the Lightning network.
 Each of these federations you can visualize as being like an island, a community, and
 then all the communities and islands are linked by the Lightning network.
 You can also think of a federation as something like a cross between a community bank that
 holds your money and a Facebook group where you have your social activity, but obviously
 infinitely better because your local community's money and online data is secured by local
 people rather than trusting big banks or bankers or big tech.
 I think this is exactly how we increase Bitcoin adoption globally.
 Here's another plus, the guardians of the federation cannot see how much Bitcoin you
 hold inside the fediment or what transactions you are making with people inside of the federation.
 So this is what we mean when we say by making Bitcoin usage more private, add higher layers.
 Now federations can also compete globally for members obviously.
 Let a million federations bloom.
 This is healthy free market competition.
 So unlike having just a few large global exchanges like Coinbase and Binance where non-tech savvy
 people store their Bitcoin or even worse, BlockFi and Celsius, instead you're going
 to use a federation that you trust or federations that you trust and that treat you well and
 that compete for your business.
 And thanks to the Lightning Network and the Bitcoin Network, each federation as we said
 is interoperable with every other federation.
 It's very easy to move between them using the Lightning Network.
 Another nice thing about having lots of federations, it makes it really difficult for any government
 to go after them.
 So governments and regulators may not even know who the members and guardians of each
 federation are.
 And if they shut down one federation in a certain locale through force or regulatory
 action, 10 more new federations can spring up in its place.
 And a federation can be in a different country or jurisdiction with more friendly regulations.
 You can have the guardians of the federation be in different jurisdictions as well.
 A federation can obviously contain members from every region, any region of the world.
 If you extend this, you can begin to imagine a world in which the majority of Bitcoin is
 stored on 100,000 different federations scattered around the world rather than being concentrated
 on large exchanges like Binance or Coinbase.
 Now if you're a serious Bitcoiner, you'll probably still have most of your Bitcoin in
 self-custody, either single SIG or multi-SIG on a hardware wallet in cold storage.
 But you may also choose to send some of your Bitcoin to a local federation, your local
 village, your local neighborhoods federation for example, for everyday purchases.
 Or you may choose to earn e-cash, which is of course convertible as we said to on-chain
 BTC or lightning BTC at any time.
 You may choose to earn e-cash by providing goods and services to federation members.
 And when you have enough e-cash built up inside the federation, you can always withdraw to
 and your hardware wallet. One cool thing is, as I understand it, you can run any kind of software
 inside of a federation like this, which is even more exciting and makes this project even more
 extensible. If you want to read more about the protocol itself, you can go to Fetimint.org,
 which I'll link to in the description notes below. This word Fetimint comes from sort of a word
 smash of federated Chamian mint, and it's called a Chamian mint. It's called Chamian e-cash,
 which was conceived of by David Chom in the 1980s. And his version of DigiCash or e-cash
 was actually almost included in an early version of the Windows operating system. We can imagine
 how different history would have been if that had happened. But as I understand it, David Chom
 wanted a little too much money from Bill Gates and it never happened. But this is an idea whose
 time has come. It did not work when you had to back it with US dollars, but it will work if you
 can back it with Bitcoin. If you want to learn more about the company that is building on this
 protocol, it's Feti.xyz and I'll link to that in the description notes below. Feti, the company
 was founded by three people, by Eric Sirian, by Obi Nwasu, and by Justin Moon. And so it'd be very
 exciting to see what they do with this. They launched a version of this to demonstrate to
 people at the Prague Bitcoin conference, where people used it to chat with each other, to send
 and receive sats and buy stuff when they're at the Bitcoin Prague conference. I'll link to that in
 the description notes below. I know there are going to be a lot of questions about Bitcoin
 custody and the trade-offs involved. Why in the world would you want to give your Bitcoin to a
 federation? And I think we have to think about it in these terms. So you first have your centralized
 third-party custody done by people you don't know personally. And this has been the model
 for most people where Sam Bankman-Fried holds your Bitcoin or Celsius or BlockFi or Coinbase.
 And this is always a bad idea. This is where most Bitcoin, how most Bitcoin I believe is still being
 held in third-party custodians who don't have to give you your Bitcoin back if they choose not to,
 or if the government tells them not to. So this is always a bad idea, this sort of centralized
 third-party custody where you don't really know the people who are holding your Bitcoin and you're
 forced to trust them. That's always a bad idea. Then at the other end of the spectrum, we have
 self-custody. You hold your own Bitcoin on a hardware wallet. This is always a good idea,
 but not everyone will do it as we said at the beginning of this video. Very young people,
 very old people, very non-tech savvy people. And so Fetiment is a sort of in the middle of this.
 It's a compromise where the guardians are people that you already trust both individually and you
 trust not to collude against you and steal your Bitcoin. Now you may turn out to have been wrong,
 to trust them. They may end up stealing your Bitcoin, but they do have social capital to lose.
 Whereas Sam Bankman-Fried is on the other side of a computer terminal. He doesn't really care
 about you and you don't really know him. So this is the difference when you have people,
 trusted people from your community running a federation. And again, as we said, when you
 reach a certain amount of Bitcoin or Sats within the federation in the form of e-cash, it's probably
 wise to ask to withdraw it and hold it on a hardware wallet in self custody if you're able
 to do this. So one way of visualizing this is your hardware wallet again is your long-term savings.
 That's like your savings account. And then the federation or Fetiment could be like your checking
 account where you spend money within the community. And again, you could be part of a number of
 different federations. You could have the federation where you do your grocery shop,
 shopping at organic grocery stores. You can have the federation where all the ranchers are,
 where all the farmers are, where all the artists are, the musicians, et cetera. And in this way,
 I think this is a way of bringing Bitcoin adoption to many, many more people in the world and really
 helping it to spread and to be used in a decentralized, localized manner. So I'm
 very excited about Fetiment and I'm excited to see what the guys at Fetty continue to roll out.
