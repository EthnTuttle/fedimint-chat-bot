 (upbeat music)
 - Everybody, welcome to the "What Is Money?" show.
 I am thrilled to have you here joining me on my mission
 to help shine light on the corruption of money.
 Now, a little bit about this show and how it makes money.
 We are 100% sponsor-based,
 which means that all the revenues we derive
 come from sponsorships.
 But I try to be very selective about the sponsors
 that I work with,
 specifically trying to choose those who have values
 well-aligned to the values expressed on this show,
 like freedom, education, self-sovereignty, et cetera.
 So what I'm gonna do is a few ad reads
 right here at the top of the show,
 and then a few ad reads in the middle.
 And I hope you won't skip them.
 I hope you'll take the time,
 listen and see what they have to offer,
 'cause again, these are hand-selected sponsors.
 Now I'd like to tell you about our sponsor,
 Pacific Bitcoin Conference,
 brought to you by Swan.
 Now this is gonna be a two-day event in Los Angeles,
 November 10th and 11th, 2022.
 And if you haven't been to a Bitcoin conference yet,
 I highly recommend it,
 as there really is no better way
 to get integrated into the Bitcoin community.
 Speakers announced so far include Michael Saylor,
 Lynn Alden, many others.
 I'll be speaking as well.
 Michael Saylor's even quoted as saying,
 "This is going to be the event of the year."
 So you definitely don't wanna miss it.
 So go to pacificbitcoin.com
 and use discount code BREEDLOVE
 to get your tickets today.
 Now I'd like to tell you about our sponsor, Leden.
 Leden lets you do more with your digital assets.
 For instance, Leden offers a B2X loan product
 that lets you leverage your existing Bitcoin
 to buy even more Bitcoin.
 Or you can also get traditional Bitcoin collateralized
 US dollar loans through Leden as well.
 Leden also offers both Bitcoin
 and USDC denominated savings accounts,
 letting you generate yield on your digital assets.
 Recently, Leden has launched a Bitcoin mortgage product
 as well that lets you use Bitcoin to buy a home
 or finance one that you already own.
 So go to leden.io,
 that's L-E-D-N.io today to sign up.
 - Obi Nwasu, welcome to the "What Is Money?" show.
 Robert Breedlove.
 What's the history of Breedlove actually?
 - I've never had a guest open me up
 with a question like that right out of the gate.
 It's from a Scottish clan
 and it translated from wolf hunter
 down to Breedlove.
 Yeah, so it doesn't at all,
 not at all what you would expect,
 but that's where it comes from.
 - Well, I was just in Edinburgh two days ago
 for UK Bitcoin conference
 and I used to live in Glasgow for four years
 and I was made an honorary Scotsman at the time.
 So it just reminded me how much I really like the passion
 of Scottish people and Scottish culture.
 So great heritage.
 - Yes, great heritage.
 I just learned recently that it was a lot of the theologians,
 thinkers and philosophers from Scotland
 that created the spirit of what would become
 the Declaration of Independence in the US Constitution.
 I don't know a lot about that,
 but looking forward to learning more.
 Just by way of quick introduction for my audience,
 you are the CEO and co-founder of Fedi,
 which is a new but very important Bitcoin company.
 You're also a board member at some other Bitcoin companies,
 which I'll leave it to you
 whether you want to describe those or not.
 And technically you are a Nigerian prince.
 I just thought I had to throw that one in
 for my audience as well.
 - Yeah, I don't really, technically,
 but my father was a king of yams,
 so there's a type of title and as such,
 being his son, I'm technically a prince,
 but it's not a significant title.
 I'm not hobnobbing with the British royalty
 or anything like that.
 - Well, I think it still sounds pretty important.
 So you can use it with a lot of gravitas over here.
 This conversation has been a long time coming
 and I appreciate you coming on to do this.
 I guess you and I talked originally about this,
 maybe what, two or three years ago, I suppose.
 We just had kind of a long informal discussion
 about what we would talk about if we did the show.
 And then we more recently had another one of those.
 And I think you have some very fascinating perspectives,
 both in that you work very closely to Bitcoin.
 You see how it's evolving on the ground, so to speak,
 working at the front lines of this network
 and its proliferation in the world.
 But then you also seem to have a lot of deep,
 more visionary type thoughts about where all this is going.
 And so, like I said, I'm really excited to have you on
 and talk about this.
 And I guess a place to start,
 not really sure exactly where we could start,
 but this idea you have about the dichotomy
 between regulated and real Bitcoin.
 And now, I guess this is more of a future oriented vision
 where you see things going, but if you would be so kind,
 could you please just unpack for us what these terms mean?
 And is this something that exists today in the world
 or is this something that we're headed towards?
 How do you describe this regulated versus real Bitcoin?
 - Yeah, so,
 2013, I and my co-founder at the time launched CoinFlow
 and it went on to become the UK's longest running
 Bitcoin exchange.
 But at that point, and I could talk about that more,
 I think we were, in the years preceding that and early 2013,
 we were in the Bitcoin was being effectively ignored
 by mainstream.
 It was still something only for geeks
 and a few libertarians.
 And as such, the people around then had much more time
 to think about why they were devoting their time
 to this thing, what it meant.
 There were less distractions with alternative coins,
 less distractions by mainstream.
 And you saw that you had the Nakamoto Institute
 would come out with these well thought out,
 long form articles.
 And it was just a great time for people
 who want to think deeply about what were the potential
 impacts of Bitcoin.
 And CoinFlow was no exception.
 We were working on building this product.
 And at that time was just getting people to notice
 this Bitcoin thing, beyond the distractions.
 We would have lots of very deep conversations.
 My co-founders and a lot of the senior engineers,
 if you're an engineer working in this,
 you'll still be tend to be quite philosophical.
 One of the engineers and I would have conversations
 about where it would all end up.
 And at one point he put an article on Reddit,
 which as running this startup,
 so I didn't really want to put my name to it,
 but definitely we were on exactly the same page
 with the vision.
 And it became very clear that we were going to see
 a fork is the wrong word,
 but definitely a split in Bitcoin.
 The reason why a fork is a wrong word
 is because a fork of a blockchain
 has a certain technical description.
 And the end result is two completely separate
 parallel blockchains effectively.
 At some point they are incompatible with each other.
 We saw that happen with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash
 a couple of years later, you had the wars
 and other altcoins have experienced a similar thing.
 But what became clear here, and this was by the way,
 prior to the proliferation of blockchain monitoring companies
 and so on, but it became clear
 that there is going to be a tension.
 As people, as countries, as regulators
 eventually started to understand the potential of Bitcoin,
 it became clear in 2013, 2014,
 that there will be increasing demands to regulate Bitcoin.
 But the true nature and power of Bitcoin
 is to be something that is freedom finance.
 It's meritocratic money that anyone can use.
 And ultimate utility comes from its network effect.
 And ultimate network effect comes from
 having the least restrictions on who you can interact with.
 Any restriction will reduce this network effect.
 And so this desire for ultimate utility
 and this desire for increased control over this new asset
 will lead to two types of Bitcoin
 coexisting on the same blockchain,
 not a fork where they no longer coexist,
 but on the same blockchain.
 And so there needs to be a classification
 of those two types.
 One would be, for want of a better word,
 sometimes in that original Reddit post
 they were called black Bitcoin,
 but another way of describing them would be real Bitcoin.
 And those would be the ones that are out
 with the regulated system.
 They are free, that you can send them from anyone to anyone,
 but they'll be increasingly have difficulties
 being able to interact with the regulated system.
 And then there will be these other approved
 or in the original article, they're called white Bitcoin.
 And another way I like to think about them
 sort of visually is regulated Bitcoin.
 And these ones would be approved
 and therefore allowed within the regulated system.
 And they would circulate around the regulated system.
 And over time, the ability to go from real Bitcoin
 to regulated Bitcoin and back again
 become more and more difficult
 until we get to a point where
 we will ultimately see real Bitcoin
 not able to interact with the regulated Bitcoin ecosystem
 through regulated channels.
 The regulated drawbridge will be raised.
 And so the only ways in which you'll be able to interact
 will be other mechanisms.
 However, because of the desire and value of being able
 desire and value of being able.
 to interact, even if there are no regulated paths, for good or for ill, there will be other ways of
 interacting. So there will be some way of being able to provide price discovery. However,
 that's where the debate continued, which one over time would be more valuable.
 No matter how we looked at it, even though it may initially be that the regulated ones
 would, from a common sense point of view, have more value than the ones outside the system.
 From our point of view, it seemed clearer that over time, the real bitcoins would gain more value
 over the regulated ones, so much so that it became very important for people to understand that
 ultimately, they should maintain a balance of real bitcoins because they will work far more than
 regulated bitcoins over time. And there are many reasons why that's the case.
 That's really interesting stuff there, this tension you've identified between Bitcoin that would be
 surveyed and controlled to some extent, existing in walled gardens, I guess, might be
 a useful analogy here, versus the Bitcoin that is just wild and free, right?
 That does seem to be somewhat of an obvious direction it's going, but it's more interesting
 that you've actually decomposed this into the consequences. And the restrictions are interesting
 too, because I'm thinking, money is valued based on its liquidity and network effects, which are
 almost kind of one of the same when it comes to money. And then any restriction you place on those
 network effects, it inhibits the value imputed to the money, right? So, in the modern fiat world,
 it makes you wonder how much money is just really being compromised in that respect.
 It's not even really private property at this point, because you can't, you go to send a wire
 and they ask you questions. Obviously, the currency is always being inflated, it's subject
 to capital controls and other regulations that just make it significantly restricted, let's say.
 And...
 Well, so the challenge you have as well is, if you have a system which is completely walled,
 and then there is no way to externally and personally verify
 whether it's being debased, and there's no way to move balances off that platform.
 And at that stage, especially with the incentives of governments and so on, you will expect that
 they will start to employ the same processes around its control and management as they would
 do for fiat, i.e. they would tend to start to debase. You'll start seeing fractional reserve
 bitcoining naturally occur. Whereas the bitcoin that's outside and outwith the system,
 that is not possible to occur. So, one will be inflated over time and the other one won't.
 So, although there is a drive towards increasing regulation in the bitcoin ecosystem as a
 mechanism to gain legitimacy, the question you have to ask yourself is, who are you aiming to
 gain legitimacy from? And are there people that you should care about their thoughts around your
 bitcoin? And if not, and I think the answer is not, then we should just focus on providing an
 alternative system that can provide you the user experience of this regulated world without having
 to kowtow to the regulated world. Yeah, I think, because if you just engage in first order thinking
 on this topic, you would tend to believe that the regulated bitcoin would obviously trade at a
 premium and be more valuable. It's approved, it's white market, it's compliant, and all these things
 that we take to be a sign of credibility in the modern world, bitcoin sort of makes you question
 what those things even mean in this bitcoinized future. And I do agree that in the distant long
 run, the opposite would be true, that you'd actually have the bitcoin with less restrictions,
 the real bitcoin would enjoy more network effects and then therefore be more valuable overall.
 And that it just gives you more options, right? If there's a bitcoin that trades between,
 among all these jurisdictions and outside of them, it seems to be clear to me that that would be more
 valuable than the bitcoin that only trades within one of those walled gardens. It's just the size
 and liquidity of the network. And I guess this is something I visit a lot here, because people say,
 "Oh, well, obviously if you're not a criminal, you'll just live within the white market and be
 happy, right? Own nothing and be happy, whatever." But that's a problem because you might not even be
 able to own the real physical bitcoin inside that walled garden. You might be just owning
 some derivative from a bank or tax or currency authority, something like that. And if that is
 the case or anything like that is the case, you know, they're going to be applying more and more
 restrictions to that over time, right? More and more control over that regulated bitcoin.
 And so I think that is what creates demand for unrestricted and unrestrictable money over time.
 It's like people, life is sort of oriented towards being more free, right? It always,
 given the option, it'll choose the thing that gives itself more options. And so that's kind
 of what we're talking about here is the money that really affords its users the most options
 will tend to be the most successful over time. - Yeah. And I think there's a
 sort of a development in thinking around optionality and trust and verification. So
 if we look at the existing financial system, it's very much that don't verify completely trust.
 And the challenge of that is it's rife with people being able to take advantage of that trust
 because no one wishes to verify. Now with Bitcoin, we have this base layer, which is
 obviously communicates and is a dump of the philosophy of don't trust verify. And as a base
 layer, that's incredibly powerful. Now that we have gone well over a decade now, I think we have
 a level of maturity of an industry to understand that there is value to be able to form trust
 groups. If you can form trust groups, you can, any human endeavor that's above a certain level
 of complexity needs organizations and there needs to be some level of trust. So trust is very,
 very powerful to be able to achieve big tasks. However, when you combine it with the discipline
 of also always verifying as well, to the extent that you can, that's when something special happens.
 So trust allows you to achieve big tasks. Verification allows you to protect yourself
 from people who will take advantage of that trust. It makes you bulletproof from bad actors.
 And that combination is, I think, the final state that you want to enter, of course. And you can
 have that verification as part of the basic tenets of anybody within the system by having
 the money have that as its basic tenets. And then the philosophy around that money,
 continually advise people and educate people to find any means possible to verify on an ongoing
 basis, all the different parties that they are trusting. So that comes from a philosophy and
 the philosophy around Bitcoin has that. Everything else we've seen, the existing fiat system,
 by decree, by trust, is clearly not in that realm. And this other wave of altcoins that
 tend to all be, or any significant one, is proof of stake, which is again,
 eventually becomes a trust-based system. We'll have flawed and weak philosophical foundations.
 And as a result, you end up with flawed and weak end state.
 Yeah, that's an excellent point there. We trust is like a necessary ingredient for social
 coordination. We can't verify everything everyone does all the time. That would just be too
 expensive and sort of defeat the purpose of social coordination in the first place,
 which is the economic division of labor. But at the same time, that trust opens up the system to
 being gamed. If you just trust someone blindly without any option of verification or... Yeah,
 option, I guess we'll do. You run the risk of making the system unstable. People just violate
 the trust effectively. So you need verification as a necessary counter force to that trust,
 to expose violations of that trust. And it's that balance that makes a system coherent and stable.
 And yeah, that's why fiat doesn't work, right? Just trust, never verify. And then what does
 that typically end up in is a hyperinflation where all the trust has been abused to the point of
 decimating the currency system. And that's the challenge is trust is natural from the point that
 you're born, babies have to trust their parents implicitly. We have a natural inclination to trust.
 Verification to verify is not as natural because of the fact that say, most people are taught to
 just trust, trust their parents, trust their teachers and so on and so forth. So if you want
 to build a very strong, resilient society, you need to have some mechanism to remind people to
 verify all the time and constantly think about how they can verify because the trust bit naturally
 happens. You don't need to do much to make sure that happens. Now, having again, during many of
 these sort of early days when we were trying to get people to understand the importance of Bitcoin,
 we spent a lot of time thinking about how you could build up this.
 sort of culture around verification that was as strong as the natural culture around trust
 to compensate for the risks of a society that's reliant purely on blind trust.
 And the end result is simple. The base primitives that you build your culture on and that everybody
 interacts with, one of them being the storage and transfer of value, should have that built into it.
 Because then the philosophy of the society that's built on a foundation of don't just verify
 will build up a healthy attitude towards verification, not just when it comes to their
 money, but when it comes to the schooling, when it comes to medicine, when it comes to everything
 else. It's like this sort of Fort virus, a meme, I think now we call it, but it's
 this incredible powerful tool that you can apply to everything else you do.
 The importance is to understand that we should use that tool, it's a superpower,
 the desire and the reminder to constantly verify what we do, but we shouldn't throw the baby out
 with the bathwater. The ability to form trusted groups is incredibly powerful as well. We just
 need a healthy dose of verification to make it reach its final form.
 Absolutely. I think here of convertibility to gold with a bank, it's fine to put your savings
 in a bank and trust the bank to not run a fractional reserve or abscond with your money,
 but you have to maintain that option to convert into real money and exit to another bank.
 The existence of that option is what keeps the bank honest. They know they can lose
 your business at any time. The word trust here, it's a little bit muddied perhaps,
 because what we're really talking about is a reduction of interpersonal trust
 and an increase in, I don't know what you call the other one, maybe a phenomenological trust.
 We're basically saying a money based less on trusting people, more on trusting math,
 something like that. That would be much more useful than this don't verify trust model,
 which gets us into lots of trouble. You have this pin tweet. That's really interesting.
 You basically, and I'll let you tell the story, but you made a rough prediction of where you think
 Bitcoin is going in the years ahead. You're quoting Gandhi here. If you'd be so kind,
 could you just unpack that story a little bit for us? What inspired the tweet? Last time we talked,
 you broke it down into how you saw these phases unfolding. Could you just explain that a little
 bit to us? Yeah, no problem. The tweet actually I found out, I'm not sure who the original
 reference is for the tweets, but my understanding is actually Gandhi wasn't the person who
 originally created this tweet, but most people attributed to Gandhi. That's just an interesting
 aside. But he originally had this statement about how change occurs when you have right on your side
 and you have a movement for change. The statement is first they ignore you,
 then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win. As you see these stages happen,
 you should use these to give you confidence that you're going the right way. If they just ignore
 you and they never pay attention to you after several years, then you're probably not doing
 something significant. If they laugh at you, it could be then there's a risk that you're just
 doing something ridiculous or it's just the first sign that you are onto something. You know that
 you're onto something when they start to fight you because if they've gone through those intervening
 steps, you are doing something very powerful. They now recognize it. It's more than just a joke
 and they begin to fight. As long as you maintain the courage of your convictions
 and the fundamental idea retains its quality and its ability to change the world,
 then you will eventually win. That was the basic idea. Now, having run CoinFloor over the years,
 when we started, everybody was ignoring us. We tried very hard to get people to care about Bitcoin.
 I remember going to events, talking about Bitcoin, no one wanted to know.
 Then something happened. We went through the first, well, it wasn't the first,
 but a significant bear market after Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox is an exchange that was at the time one of
 the largest exchanges in the world and it famously imploded in 2012, 2013 range.
 At that point, we transitioned. People then took notice because they started to talk about large
 amounts of money, but they just thought that this was a technology that was bound to fail.
 People working in the industry were often laughed at by members of the traditional
 industry, the traditional financial sector. That proceeded for a number of years
 until we went through another rally in price. Bitcoin went up to around nearly $20,000,
 similar price to where it is today, actually. Then we hit another bear market, the price
 of Bitcoin dropped. At that point, people still initially laughed at it. Then it held,
 it stuck at the low thousands, three, four, five thousand, and it stayed flat.
 What was also happening was that in the Bitcoin industry, excitement for Bitcoin resolve
 was stronger than ever. People were working on incredibly interesting projects.
 We could see grassroots take up of Bitcoin was still proceeding. Then we saw another switch in
 people's behavior. When I say people, it's the traditional financial sector and the regulatory
 space. At that point, they started the process of wanting to understand Bitcoin to set up
 cryptographic task force and the like. Now, this was the beginning of a very significant phase.
 This was around 2018. About a year later, one of the first
 results of that, products of that, was on an international basis, was the determination by
 the Financial Action Task Force, also known as FATF, to approve a recommendation for
 cryptocurrencies, obviously including Bitcoin. It had a number of different bits in it,
 but the most controversial and the most famous is the travel rule. What the travel rule
 determined was that just like traditional fiat, traditional fiat banking, and the traditional
 financial space, Bitcoin transactions and other cryptocurrencies would need to provide
 identifying information if it's going from between one regulated service provider,
 financial service provider, to another. Now, ostensibly, this seems to only be something
 that relates to regulated institutions, but in order to determine whether you're receiving money
 from a regulated entity or not, or you're sending money to a regulated entity or not,
 you would have to still provide this information, IKYC, know your customer,
 or receive that from anyone depositing to you or anyone you're sending to, because there's no way
 you will know that they weren't regulated until you know who they are. Even though the wording
 focuses on the regulated space, the only way of implementing it would require you to provide
 this requirement to effectively dox, deposit some withdrawals for anyone interacting with the
 regulated space, whether they're an individual or not, at least for the first time, to understand
 who they are. Now, it was at that point, we were at 2019, and for the following year, you could see
 more of this happening around the world, where it dawned on me that we were seeing a process similar
 to what Gandhi had talked about many years, many decades earlier. When I mapped it from 2008, when
 Bitcoin was first written about in the white paper, until 2013, for about five years, it was really
 clear during that period, up until around the time we launched CoinFloor, Bitcoin was ignored.
 No one really cared about it in mainstream. Then from 2013, for the next five years to 2018,
 up until the second crash, Bitcoin was laughed at, it was ridiculed.
 And this was the period where I would go to events held in the City of London,
 by members of the traditional space, these Chatham House Rules events, describe what we're
 doing in Bitcoin, and literally around these tables, we were laughed at. So this is not a
 metaphor, this is the reality. It was considered a joke. Friends of mine who worked in the City of
 London would again, constantly laugh at what we were doing. We would explain how this was an
 incredibly powerful and transformative technology, but it didn't really hold water with most people.
 And then again, Bitcoin went from 19,000 and it dropped to by 70% or more. And the laugh,
 the crescendo of laughing continued. And then as we got towards 2018, and it wasn't
 continuing to go to zero,
 the laughing died down. And it's around 2018, you started seeing these cryptographic task force.
 And what I realized, when, again, having run a regulated exchange and, and being one of the
 people who worked very hard to help get Bitcoin exchanges be to help them become regulated,
 because I had the naive view, the first order thinking view that this would be ultimately
 beneficial for Bitcoin. And maybe, maybe it was beneficial during that phase.
 I started to realize that Bitcoin was being attacked.
 The challenge here is that Bitcoin is a philosophy, Bitcoin is a technology,
 Bitcoin is code, it's speech. It's, it's non physical. And as such,
 you cannot attack a non physical idea with guns or nuclear bombs just doesn't work. So how do you
 wage war against an idea? And what should you look for? What signs you look for that is happening?
 And when I thought about it, there's only two ways you can wage war against an idea,
 through misinformation and regulation. And now regulation is on a spectrum, you can have very
 light touch regulation, all the way through to extreme regulation, also known as banning.
 But it's just exists on its spectrum. But any restrictions is some form of regulation.
 And those are the only two things you could do. And when I when I realized that in 2020,
 I looked back over the last two years, and realized that we were seeing an ever increasing
 rise in misinformation about Bitcoin. And we were seeing the first fruits of increasing regulation.
 So my realization was that we were in the period where we were being attacked.
 And given the time it had taken for the other two periods of loss, I was pretty confident that we
 would hit a crescendo within the following three years, there'll be another five year period.
 The other reason why I had that view was that the fathers advice because they're an unelected body,
 and they only provide advice, it just so happens that the implications of not taking advice
 are profound for a country, because they would, they would could be put on the
 fat of sanctions lists, which means that almost every other country's financial institutions
 would would not interact with you, effectively, separating you from the rest of the financial
 ecosystem, which would be devastating. So it's advice, but it's advice that almost every country
 always takes. But because it's delivered on a country level, when you look back at previous
 advice, it's normally takes three to six years to roll out that advice across countries. So in 2019,
 the clock started ticking. With a view that by 2022, most of the world would have implemented
 them, you get the stragglers over the following three years, but the biggest, most powerful
 countries implement it within three or four years. So that also correlated to the peak of the attack,
 being 2022 2023. However, at that point, we have we have two possible futures happening.
 Either that regulation succeeds, and in which case Bitcoin no longer is real Bitcoin will will
 cease to exist, and we'll only have regulated Bitcoin. And if we only have regulated Bitcoin,
 we do not have Bitcoin. Or Bitcoin succeeds. Now, when I looked at the ecosystem of Bitcoin,
 I looked at the technologies that were gaining adoption. Obviously, Bitcoin itself, and lightning
 were foremost amongst them. I had very strong confidence that when Bitcoin when we get to this
 point, this final battle, Bitcoin will succeed and it succeeds by surviving. As long as long as there
 is one node somewhere. So running, then Bitcoin succeeds. And when you realize that you realize
 that it's an it's almost impossible task for regulators to completely ban Bitcoin. So Bitcoin
 will therefore win. And just like we saw in 2018, after Bitcoin fell, once Bitcoin continues to
 survive, the realization amongst the general population is that this is there for good.
 So this so the prediction was that 2023 will be the final battle and Bitcoin will succeed. Now,
 I'm actually looking to revisit that prediction near the end of this year. And
 to cut a long story short, my conclusion is that I'm more confident than ever,
 that 2023 will be the year that Bitcoin succeeds. A big part of that is because if there was one
 area that concerned me, that area would have been custody and privacy serving custody.
 Having run an exchange and they sold it at the end of last year,
 we had tried very hard and this was actually uncommon amongst exchanges to get people to
 self custody. In some cases, we literally begged people to self custody, because although we
 trusted and reliable, we understood that it's important for people to own real Bitcoin.
 And it became very clear over the years that the vast majority of people, at least in the next 10
 to 15 years, would not be comfortable with self custody, even though it's the gold standard or
 the Bitcoin standard. And there are three reasons why. Reason number one was that for many people
 globally, it's just too expensive. At this point in time, they need to earn more money, gain more
 wealth for them to be able to afford it. Reason number two was at this point in time was too
 technically complex. Again, there are a lot of very great minds working on making it simpler,
 but we're still far away from it to being technically comfortable for most people.
 And the third reason is that through years of learned behavior, most people aren't comfortable
 self custody and take responsibility to custody on their behalf. Now, I had a, I had a
 user of coin floor, who's a really streetwise woman of a few years older than myself a bit more
 advanced years, but really streetwise and completely understood what Bitcoin was about.
 And one day, I'm talking to her, asking and suggesting and offering help for her to self
 custody. She told me something. She said, Look, Obi, I completely get Bitcoin, I completely
 understand it. But the thing is this, I trust you more than I trust myself.
 And that was really profound for me, because it made me realize that
 we have to overcome decades worth of neuro linguistic programming around people's ability to
 to take responsibility for their money. And that's going to take decades to resolve and a lot of
 education. And I realized that we didn't have decades, we needed a way of getting people off
 exchanges, because because of that, with the best will in the world, we're going to get to 5%,
 maybe 10% of the people on the planet being able to self custody, but that would leave 90%
 trapped in this regulated coin world, which means after rules like the like the travel rule coming
 into fruition around the world, which would mean that they would be lost for Bitcoin.
 So it was with that understanding that I seek and I looked for ways of getting people off exchanges.
 And it was in 2021 at hackers Congress, that I met my co founder, Eric Syrian, one of my now one
 of my two co founders. And he told me about a project he was working on called FediMint.
 Now, in his mind, it was this incredible privacy preserving technology, which it was.
 But it was much more than that this. When I looked at it, having my background as running
 exchange and looking for a way to get people off exchanges, I realized it represented just that
 it wasn't the Bitcoin standard of self custody. But it was a way of getting people off regulated
 exchanges, which was an important, huge first step. And when you combine that with a, a remit,
 and an objective of constant lifelong learning, where we write we weave into the application,
 ongoing financial education, and also providing the mechanisms to retain wealth, so people over
 time, gain disposable income and wealth, you can see a path to getting more and more people
 self custodying as well. But the first thing you have to do is when the drawbridge gets drawn up,
 there needs to be an option for people to go to en masse at scale. And I believe that drawbridge
 is happening in 2023. And now with the existence of FediMint, in combination with Lightning, and,
 and Bitcoin, obviously, as a base, trust minimized layer,
 we have even more of a guarantee that we will win in 2023.

 Really interesting. Now I'd like to tell you about our sponsor, CrowdHealth. CrowdHealth is a
 Bitcoin enabled alternative to legacy health insurance. Now let's face it, legacy health
 insurance is an absolute scam. Nobody can explain this better than the legendary comedian, Chris
 Rock. So with CrowdHealth, instead of just paying premiums that you'll never see again,
 you can hold part of this pool of savings in dollars and in Bitcoin through CrowdHealth.
 And when you have a health event, you can draw against this pool of communal savings.

 Just to read the tweet, which I don't know if we did or not, but you wrote that 2008
 to 2013, Bitcoin is ignored.
 2013 to 2018, Bitcoin is ridiculed.
 2018 to 2023, Bitcoin is attacked.
 And from 2023 onward, Bitcoin wins.
 And you posted that December 2020.
 So I think it's really interesting.
 And I'm curious, you said Bitcoin succeeds by surviving, which is, there's a lot packed
 into that, right?
 Bitcoin is, that is all really Bitcoin does is it's optimized to survive no matter what
 comes at it, no matter what attacks thrown at it, subversion strategies, anything.
 It's just really designed to survive and hold supply cap.
 Those are the kind of the two things it really does.
 And you said, so Bitcoin being attacked between 2018 and 2023, these attacks have not become
 overt yet though.
 I mean, I guess there's some subversive discussion about how Bitcoin is not environmentally friendly,
 does not comply with ESG standards and whatnot.
 Do you anticipate a more overt attack on Bitcoin between now and the end of 2023?
 I do.
 And I think we're starting to see that.
 If what I monitor various different things, and especially the edicts of global unelected
 advisory bodies.
 So you have FATF, you have the World Economic Forum, you have IMF, you have the World Bank,
 you have the Bank of International Settlements, and you have the Financial Stability Board.
 Now all of these focus on different aspects of finance, global finance and financial stability
 and maintaining orderly markets, maintaining the effectiveness of central banks, countering
 terrorist financing and money laundering and other financial crimes, and dealing with the
 payment of loans and repayment of loans from various countries, some of the more disadvantaged
 countries in the world.
 But taking it together, these are different systems to provide a way of maintaining order,
 however you define order within global financial markets and in global economies.
 And they have all in the last 12 months come out with advice, their views, opinions on
 cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin.
 And if you look at those, and sometimes they've come up with updated views, they've only got
 stronger and stronger and stronger, and they've only got more and more explicit.
 One of their hot, most of their biggest hot buttons is stablecoins.
 That's by far the thing that they are most concerned about.
 And in a way, that's one thing I like about stablecoins, because they provide covering
 fire for the real important financial innovation, which is Bitcoin.
 Then they also have interest in the latest and greatest altcoin saviour as well, whether
 it be ICOs, or then they move on to NFTs or DeFi or whatever.
 Again, I would argue controversial that I see a utility to these.
 But the biggest utility is that they provide covering fire for Bitcoin to continue to operate.
 But that is actually a useful thing that they do.
 And that is useful until we have the elements in place to make sure, or I believe we're
 already past that point, the elements in place to make sure that we have all the tools to
 en masse get people at rapid, rapid scale, get people out of the regulated system, the
 regulated coin system into the real coin world, where they have the most value, the most ability
 to interact.
 They have the most, they are based on this anti-fragile money.
 And therefore we have the ability to create, from an engineer's perspective, is the ideal
 world, which is one that's built on meritocracy.
 So i.e. the quality of your argumentation and how hard you work should be the determinant
 of success as much as possible.
 Now there's always going to be some inefficiencies where familial relationships and so on and
 nepotism can lead to short term benefits.
 But we don't want it to be entrenched.
 We want ultimately good quality argument, good quality thinking and hard work to be
 the determinant, the measuring stick of success in the world, wherever you are.
 And while we don't have that, right now there's probably 50 Einsteins out there and 100 Elon
 Musk's, but they just haven't been discovered because the way the world works right now
 makes it hard for them to be discovered.
 And not only do they lose out because of that, but everybody in the world loses out.
 Imagine we had 50 more Einsteins and 100 more Elon Musk's working today, because they are
 there somewhere.
 We would all be living on Mars, using our anti-gravity pods to, you know, and we would
 have solved so many problems.
 So we all lose out from that.
 And that is the potential for a world which is built on a meritocratic money.
 So yeah, it's now with the fundamental building blocks being in place, Bitcoin has been going
 on for more than a decade and it's shown itself to be incredibly stable.
 Without this huge ICO fueled marketing machine, it continues to maintain and increase its
 dominance.
 It continues to become more and more censorship resistance.
 Even if you take China, one of the most authoritarian regimes, clearly an authoritarian regime,
 where they issued an edict completely banning Bitcoin mining.
 A year or so later, we're back at 20% of the entire global Bitcoin mining is happening
 from China.
 And that's where it's kind of, so if they, one of the most authoritarian regimes in the
 world is not able to control Bitcoin mining, then democracies are not going to be able
 to control Bitcoin mining, even if they chose to ban it.
 So we know that's to be the case.
 We know Bitcoin is, again, continue to operate in a really incredibly strong manner.
 And we have a healthy ecosystem of people working on the open source technology.
 We have organizations like I'm a board member for B-Trust, and we are locating, educating
 and enumerating Bitcoin open source protocol engineers, but not just from the West, but
 from the rest.
 So starting in Africa, but expanding across the rest of the global South to add to the
 diversity and add to the resilience of the people who can work full time on Bitcoin.
 So again, Bitcoin is really strong.
 Lightning continues to advance, continues to show this hockey stick like growth and
 adoption.
 And again, there are more resources that are coming to play in supporting people working
 on that.
 And the final challenge around custody, I believe there are a number of people working
 on this.
 So we're not the only one.
 There are other people working on making Bitcoin custody, privacy preserving, and something
 that's viable, easy enough and viable for people to come off of exchanges and use.
 But I focus on Fedi and I know that Fedi and Fedimint by itself is good enough.
 So now that I know it's already good enough to get billions of people off, then the custody
 problem has been solved.
 We may be one of many people who solve it, but we only need one to solve it.
 We already have that one.
 So the ecosystem is ready for 2023.
 And so I'm really excited because we'll come to the battle with weapons that the opposition
 cannot imagine.
 And our objective is just to survive.
 Their objective is to destroy every single last one.
 And that is an impossibility.
 Right.
 And Bitcoin certainly has the ultimate or offers users, I guess, the ultimate defender's
 advantage that you can just occupy this nearly unassailable place if you're in the proper
 custody schema.
 And if you've taken measures in regard to privacy, then you're hard to identify.
 even at that point as a target. I like this. You've been dropping some good bombs today.
 Bitcoin is meritocratic money. That's a really good one too. Nice and simple. And I guess
 it would imply then that fiat currency is almost, it's the opposite of that. I don't
 know what that is. Maybe autocratic money or corrupt money, something like that. It's
 not succeeding based on its own merits. It's succeeding in the marketplace at the point
 of a gun, right? You basically have to use this or else pay your taxes in this or else,
 et cetera. And that I'm reminded of another Gandhi quote from that. And he said that civil
 disobedience becomes a sacred duty when the state has become lawless or corrupt. So I
 guess we're engaging in some kind of Gandhi and civil disobedience just by working with
 Bitcoin or holding Bitcoin, saving in Bitcoin. My question to you is if Bitcoin is being
 attacked today, the fight is underway, let's say roughly 2018 through present, you think
 through the end of 2023, maybe longer if you revise your prediction, as you said. Does
 that mean we are moving toward this regulated versus real Bitcoin split? Does that come
 as a result of these attacks? How does the attack on Bitcoin, I guess, translate into
 this split that we explored at the top of the show between regulated and real Bitcoin?
 I think while you've hit the nail on the head, it's one of these, if you can't beat them,
 join them. But instead, they want to subsume Bitcoin. So the idea would be to regulate
 it, make it appear like it's something that they've now worked with, but ultimately transform
 it into being the same as the existing system. But just maybe it becomes a rebrand. But it's
 the same dog new tricks, as it were. So the way you will see it is this adoption of regulation,
 the existing financial institution, the major banks who have historically been incredibly
 anti Bitcoin, laughed at it, said it was going to not succeed, have off-boarded more Bitcoin
 exchanges and companies than you could keep track of, potentially both openly and behind
 the scenes, and made it very difficult for Bitcoin companies to succeed. And having run
 a Bitcoin exchange in the past, I knew I've been through that pain. And if you're running
 a Bitcoin exchange right now, or a cryptocurrency exchange right now, you will be going through
 that pain as well. And it will be 10 times more difficult than it was two years ago.
 But you will be precluded from stating that because if you say anything like that, the
 way regulation works is similar in most reasonable jurisdictions. But in the UK, you have this
 concept of being fit and proper. And that's for anyone who's running a financial institution,
 or anyone who's working in the compliance department. So the entire compliance department,
 and the breadth of the organization at the senior levels, they have to be fit and proper.
 Fitness requires them to completely understand the technicalities of the law, of regulation.
 And that seems reasonable, you should understand what you should be skilled in your craft.
 But proprietary is a very interesting one, because it's subjective, you need to behave
 in this proper manner. But proper is at the definition of the regulator. And they never
 make it fully clear what that definition is, they give you these broad things that you
 should behave in a proper manner and so on. But they leave it for you to decide what that
 is. So for example, you have to take a risk based approach when onboarding users. But
 again, you have to decide what the risk is. And you have to decide how you define a risk
 based approach. They can give you these high level terms, like you don't want to take unnecessary
 risks. And if you are taking a high risk, then you have to have appropriate level of
 process to take that risk into account. But both of these seemingly innocuous rules lead
 to this culture of fear. Because the punishment of getting it wrong is your business that
 you may have worked many, you know, sweated blood, blood, sweat and tears on, and employs
 many people may be shut down with one major one mistake as deemed by the regulators. And
 you never fully know whether you're going too far. So this is a very powerful tool to
 control regulated regulated industry. And that tool only works if you're in the regulated
 space. So without having to do much work, I get this as synchronous level of, of control.
 And this is why you're going to see this switch. And this is why there's a desire to move people
 into the regulated world with these sort of enticements of ease of banking, all this pain
 you've been going through for the last 10 years, don't you want it to go away, just
 agree to be as part of this regulated system, and it'll be easy, you'll be good at banking,
 and if you want, you'll be able to use all the services and features that you want to,
 but you are now trapped within the system. And the punishment of ever making a mistake
 going forward and letting the wrong person have an account, however, you define wrong,
 we can't be very clear as to what is wrong, you have to define that. But if you get it
 wrong, you will never the actual the punishment can be as strong as never being able to take
 on any regulated person role in the industry for the rest of your career. So you could,
 it's not just one year, two years, you could be out for the rest of your career. It's incredibly
 harsh punishment. And so I've been on many panels with people who are within the industry,
 and they are using this diplomatic language saying that they agree with the principles
 of Bitcoin, but it's important to put in reasonable regulation. You go off the stage, and I'll
 tell you, I completely 100% agree with you. But if I said that publicly, I risk huge repercussions
 for myself, the rest of my career, my company, and so on and so forth. So it's this horrible,
 insidious environment. And the moment I was able to sell CoinFlow and focus on my new
 mission, which I'm going to focus on the rest of my life, which I always stated is all Bitcoin,
 all empowering the global self, all with global impact all the time, was one of the most uplifting
 days of my life. Well, I spent probably a week just sleeping because recovering from
 eight years of running a regulated platform. And every day since then has just been better
 than the last, because you're free. And you cannot put a price on this. And the freedom
 is a mental, philosophical freedom. The only people I am now jealous of, I've met like
 in Hacker's Congress, in other parts of Latin America and Africa, where peer to peer trading
 is far more common. I've met people who've been in the Bitcoin space for one or two years,
 some of them six, seven, eight years or longer. And there's a surprising number of people
 in these parts of the world I focus on, who have bought Bitcoin, have held Bitcoin, have
 used Bitcoin for spending, maybe even traded, whatever they wish to do is they're free to
 do what they want. And they have never interacted with a regulated party from the beginning.
 Every Bitcoin they bought was bought free. All custody has been free from beginning.
 And now that they see all this regulation coming in for people who have bought on exchange
 and then withdrawn and so on, and there's still questions years later, etc. Their level
 of freedom and their sense of freedom is something that because I ran a regulated exchange, so
 I bought on a regulated exchange, I will never be able to have that, at least for the portion
 of my wealth that's touched the regulated world. But when you look in the eyes of people
 who've never had to touch the regulated world, and they've now, maybe it was difficult to
 begin with, but they've now built in the systems and structures needed to custody and acquire
 and dispose of their Bitcoin for some practical purpose, whether it's to pay for rent, whether
 it's to do whatever. It's an incredibly, it's an incredibly powerful and stark difference.
 And seeing that makes it obvious to me that these people living in real Bitcoin land,
 you're going to see it's going to be obvious to people who are in regulated Bitcoin land
 that these people are happier. They're more willing to say what they want to say. They
 have no fear. And there's just pure hope. I can never have that 100%. But I do want
 to provide systems that allow or support and educate people around how to have that future
 because it's a much more powerful, much more uplifting future for all of us.
 It's beautiful. That connection, you know, between those individuals that have lived
 entirely outside the system with Bitcoin, having no fear, like that almost is the definition
 of freedom in a way. Like you can have everything in the world. But if you're scared about anything
 inside, then you're not free, right? You're not, you're subject to whatever that fear
 is, I guess. So this idea of the connection between regulation and fear inducement in
 the society running on the regulated money is very interesting to me. So, okay, we've
 come up on time today, but I do want to continue this conversation soon.
 Obi, as always, man, really great conversation. And I look forward to doing this again soon.
 Say do I. Thank you very much, matey.
 Oh, real quick. Could you let my audience know where they could find out more about
 you or your work?
 Absolutely. So me on Twitter, I am @Obi, @Obi. I've been on Twitter for a long time,
 so I have a three letter Twitter. And Fedi is Fedi.XYZ. And Fedimint, which is the
 protocol that Fedi is based upon, is FediMint.org.
 Wonderful. Thank you again, Obi.
