 Eric, welcome to Blockstream Talk.
 Hey, nice to be on.
 Thanks for having me.
 Yeah, no problem.
 My pleasure.
 The elephant in the room.
 So the mask and glasses, is this a privacy thing?
 I'm guessing that's what it is, given your background, or is this a COVID personal protective
 equipment kind of set up?
 Good question.
 Yeah, I'm alone in this room here, so it's definitely a privacy thing.
 Given that I work on privacy technology, it's just fitting.
 I actually got inspired by some German cyberpunks, Frank Krohn and Smuggler, who established
 wearing masks at conferences for the same reason.
 I also like the style, to be honest.
 Yeah, that's good.
 Yeah, no, I've taken the opposite route.
 I've gone public for absolutely no benefit.
 So congrats.
 So maybe we can start with who are you and what you're working on?
 Yeah, I'm Eric, and I have a background in computer science with a focus on cryptography
 and distributed systems.
 And when I came to Bitcoin, it was because of libertarianism, and I was fully into the
 idea of stateless money.
 And over the years, I got more into the technical aspects of Bitcoin and noticed that there
 is this big missing feature, privacy.
 And while we have made a lot of progress over the years, things like CoinTorrent, Lightning,
 there's still a gap.
 And at some point, I got the idea, let's build E-cash on Bitcoin.
 And from there, I started getting into federated E-cash and all the good stuff.
 That's what we are talking about today.
 Yeah.
 So in your view, why is privacy important?
 And if we're talking about payments, why isn't the Lightning Network private enough in its
 current state?
 First of all, to be truly free, I think you need to be able to do a commerce in private,
 because otherwise there will always be a state that tries to tell you what you can do or
 what you can't do.
 And so it's a deep need, I think, for people that want to be truly free to have privacy
 in their money.
 And I think Lightning goes a long way already, because the sender becomes pretty private
 if they run their own Lightning node.
 The recipient, not so much right now, but there are also projects that work on this
 part.
 But the main point of Lightning is that not everyone is actually able to run a node, and
 I don't think there ever will be.
 So we will probably get into this later, but that's also a big benefit of federated E-cash.
 It's interesting, especially the context of current events, where the trend seems to be
 towards central bank digital currencies and these kind of things that remove what little
 privacy people have left to a greater degree.
 So I think that's really interesting, and I agree, probably something that's very, very
 needed.
 Interestingly, also, that's something that's completely not priced into Bitcoin at all.
 We've talked about this before.
 I think a lot of the people who are investing in Bitcoin are looking at it as a high beta
 inflation hedge.
 And the stuff that's going on in El Salvador, and I think the potential need for people
 to have more privacy in their money and the network effects that that creates, I think
 are probably something that a lot of analysts and a lot of Wall Street type people are definitely
 not even pricing into their models yet.
 So that'll be interesting to see, I think, from a price perspective also, how that develops.
 But given your focus on privacy, why do you prefer to work on Bitcoin and not something
 maybe like Monero?
 That's actually a very good question.
 I have this discussion with Monero people a lot, and it comes down to that Bitcoin is
 the only store of value, in my opinion, that will prevail long term.
 And as such, it only makes sense for me to work on this primary project, because everything
 else doesn't matter long term.
 So why waste time on it?
 Sure, if you want privacy now, using Monero might be the right choice.
 But in the long term, I believe that only Bitcoin matters, and as such, it has to be
 private.
 That's what I'm working on.
 I think that's really interesting.
 I mean, that kind of reminds me of stablecoins as well, because I think stablecoins are kind
 of like a transitionary asset.
 I think once Bitcoin price kind of, you know, stabilizes and the volatility comes out of
 Bitcoin, I think all the stablecoins probably disappear.
 And that's interesting what you're saying about privacy, as that as Bitcoin becomes
 more private, then probably all the privacy coins and projects that are focused on that
 probably disappear as well, right?
 Yeah, I'd imagine so, because Bitcoin has the best monetary properties.
 And why would I hold some money that has worse monetary properties when it's biggest in the
 advantage privacy is suddenly gone because Bitcoin's also part.
 So digging into federated e-cash, I think maybe the best place to start is to kind of
 break it up into three questions.
 So number one, who is David Chom?
 Number two, what is e-cash?
 And then number three, what are Chomian Mint?
 Yeah, let's start with David Chom.
 He is the inventor of e-cash and he first described it in a paper about blind signatures.
 And in this paper, he discovered a new signature scheme or new type of signature scheme and
 applied it to real e-cash.
 It's an amazing paper.
 Everyone should have a look at it.
 You can probably link it in the show notes.
 And he also invented some other stuff like a precursor to Chamier Cicochain.
 He's a really well-known cryptographer.
 The second point was what is e-cash?
 So imagine you have a central entity, let's call it a bank or a mint.
 Mint sounds better.
 Bitcoin sounds like banks.
 So this mint, I can give a certain amount of cash, let's say.
 Just give it $100.
 And in return, this mint will give me 100 anonymous IOU tokens that the mint now owes
 me $100 in return.
 And with these IOU tokens, I can give to other people's bank and they can then interactively
 make sure that I'm actually sending them real tokens with the mint.
 It's a relatively complex protocol.
 Maybe we get into it later.
 But the basic idea is that I have these anonymous tokens that I can use for commerce and they
 are backed by some central entity called the mint.
 Choms' work is kind of from the '80s or '90s.
 So this is a concept that's been around for quite a while.
 Why didn't Choms and Mint ever really catch on?
 Yeah, I believe it's because of the centralization of the system.
 As I mentioned, you need the central entity that is able to issue these tokens, that you
 have to send the money and that has to hold the money for the backing to work.
 And that naturally means that there's the single point of failure that regulators can
 attack.
 And while he founded a company that tried to commercialize this technology and it worked
 for a while, they had some ideas about working together with Deutsche Bank or with Microsoft,
 but it never really worked out.
 And then 9/11 happened and privacy was a big no-go.
 Nobody wanted to touch anything private, really.
 And I think at that point it became pretty much impossible with all the financial regulations
 that came to build anything like it.
 It's a concept that just kind of really needed something like something that says "decentralized
 Bitcoin" to really be fleshed out and developed.
 Yeah, I think so.
 Because the big benefit of Bitcoin is you don't have to ask for permission to build
 on it.
 Like, I can just go there and build a Chomian bank or Chomian Mint, put it on Bitcoin, and
 I'm pretty private by doing so.
 If I'm using Tor, for example, to run it, then who's going to tell who is actually running
 it?
 And in that sense, no government really can take down, assume, Tor's SEQ, which it isn't.
 So the mints are really kind of like multi-sig wallets, right?
 The controls, the Bitcoin that depositors put into it.
 And I noticed on one of the blog posts that Blockstream put up there that we went out
 of our way in bold font and italics to say, "This is not a bank."
 But to me, it does sound a little bit like a credit union, right?
 Like a credit union is member-owned, it's nonprofit, it's kind of a financial cooperative.
 So is that the way to characterize it?
 Does that kind of sound right to you, that it's something a little bit like a credit
 union?
 Yeah.
 But let's take a step back first.
 So far, I only described the concept of e-cash and e-cash on Bitcoin.
 But what I'm building now is called federated e-cash.
 And that's probably what you're getting at.
 In this system, the Bitcoins aren't held by one single entity, but rather by a set of
 members that all run this federation jointly and run this e-cash mint jointly.
 And such, they ensure that even if some of them are evil or taken down by government
 or whatever, the system still keeps running and still keeps functioning properly.
 And that's where multi-sig comes in.
 It's a great point.
 So does this sound a little bit like Liquid?
 I mean, it sounds to me a little bit like Liquid with a federation and with pegging
 in and pegging out.
 Is it kind of a similar concept?
 Yeah, exactly.
 Like Liquid was actually the inspiration for it.
 I saw what you can do with Liquid, but it's kind of held down by still requiring a blockchain
 and blockchains are inherently non-private.
 That's just a trade-off you make.
 They are auditable, but non-private.
 What do you see as the ultimate use case for this?
 Is it payments?
 Is it people who want to kind of have more privacy and anonymize their payments or are
 there other use cases for it?
 Is it a way to save money?
 Would you put all your Bitcoin in this as a way to kind of like deposit it and save
 it?
 I think we have to distinguish different use cases here.
 The first big one is payments and for that I think you would not put all your Bitcoins
 in there, but just like you're spending money, which today you might have on your lightning
 note, but if you want more privacy, you would put it on a federated e-cash mint and then
 use it day to day.
 But there are also other use cases like tumbling or you could use it as such a federation to
 pack in larger amounts of Bitcoin and then over time take them out again in equally sized
 chunks that would be pretty private.
 So it's a different form of a tumbler kind of.
 And lastly, it's also a scalability solution because now that you don't have this blockchain
 anymore, nobody really needs to verify all the data that's being sent to the federation
 or is being processed by it, but only the federation members and they can scale up the
 hard drive quite well.
 So in a sense, these federated e-cash systems can scale much better than Bitcoin.
 What do you see the scale of these federated systems?
 Like what do they look like?
 Is there just one giant one or are there ones with members of maybe four or five members
 or is it like a credit union with hundreds or thousands of members?
 What do you see this kind of evolving into?
 Yeah, so currently I imagine it to be a rather small federations because especially in the
 beginning, the software will not be 100% secure.
 That's the thing with software.
 It's not perfect.
 It's never perfect.
 It just gets more perfect over time.
 So starting out with this one big federation to rule them all would be a really bad idea
 I think and would slow down improvements because now you have to be really, really sure that
 your improvements are actually good.
 With many small federations, you have the big benefit that, for example, when I run
 the federation with some other people that are really into experimenting, then I can
 do all kinds of crazy things with it.
 While someone who is more conservative just wants to serve their users, they might run
 the older version that's still kept secure and up to date but doesn't use all these new
 fancy features.
 And so what I imagine is a network of many small federations that different groups of
 people run because there's also some trust involved.
 It's still custodial in a sense.
 It's just not one person but, for example, five.
 So you rather want to have trust relationship already to these people.
 Between federations, do you think there would be fungibility or would you be able to move
 your coins between these different federations or do you think it would be kind of locked
 within these smaller ecosystems?
 That was actually a big problem for a while when I was thinking about it.
 But then it appeared to me that if you can integrate Lightning into these federations,
 then they suddenly all become interoperable.
 As soon as you can send and receive money via Lightning in these federations, then the
 possibilities are endless.
 And it's in line with what Jack Mellor said in Miami.
 Lightning makes everything interoperable.
 That's its superpower.
 It's not even about just being a payment system, but it's an interoperability layer for all
 kinds of other systems built on Bitcoin.
 In such a way, it makes all these federations interoperable and even with the wider Lightning
 network.
 So how exactly does the Defederated Mint interact with Lightning?
 That's a relatively complicated question.
 I will try not to go into the technical details too much here.
 Please, yeah.
 Top level is fine.
 Yes, in principle, what you do is the federation in and of itself cannot currently run Lightning
 node because that would require upgrades to Lightning.
 For example, Schnorr signatures, which isn't implemented yet.
 But what you can do is have a gateway in between the federation and the wider Lightning network.
 And the gateway bridges the trust model between Lightning, which is completely trustless,
 and the federation where you have to trust these federation members.
 And inside the federation, you can have smart contracts that incentivize this gateway to
 make payments for you, for example.
 You say only if you actually can prove that you made this payment, then you get these
 Bitcoins inside the federation and at a later point.
 you can take them out and rebalance the channels.
 That's how it works on a high level.
 - So, and then is there a path here
 for having like a decentralized stable coin?
 Because as we mentioned, I mean,
 the power of stable coins is a low volatility,
 low friction asset, and Bitcoin is very low friction,
 but it's high volatility.
 So there's a massive amount of appetite
 for that kind of asset.
 And I think that's why, you know,
 there's just tens of billions of dollar
 with Tether and with USDC.
 So is there a path forward for that in this kind of setup?
 - I'm not entirely sure, to be honest.
 I'm not an expert in decentralized stable coins
 from what I hear.
 They all have the problem that whatever's backing them,
 if it goes down and value too much,
 then you have a problem.
 And you can't really solve this fundamental problem
 with federations or anything like that.
 But what I can say is such stable coins
 would be super interesting for federations to use
 if they exist.
 Because if you want, for example,
 to become a competitor to Shibo,
 which is the government's wallet in El Salvador right now,
 then you'd need to offer these people a way
 to hedge against Bitcoin's volatility.
 Because we as Bitcoins might not understand it,
 but most people are not prepared to take
 like 50% drawdowns from time to time.
 - Yeah, and it just doesn't work for commerce.
 Like you can't be selling coffee and have something that...
 - Yeah, exactly.
 So the idea would be that such a federation,
 while it interacts via Bitcoin and Lightning,
 it can also hold a stable coin inside
 and users can choose to instantly switch to a stable coin
 whenever they receive money and switch back to Bitcoin
 whenever they send money.
 And in that sense, you could emulate the functionality
 that Shibo has today in a more decentralized fashion.
 When I speak about tokens, IOU tokens,
 these are like actual little pieces of data,
 like a little text message you can send to someone
 and that's worth money.
 So it's not a token in and of itself,
 like you create a new asset class.
 I mean, it is the true kind of,
 because now we trust the federation
 to actually make it redeemable for Bitcoin.
 But in general, when I say token,
 it's just another representation of Bitcoin
 that is now applying signature more or less.
 - That you can redeem for your Bitcoin.
 - Yes, exactly.
 But it's not on liquid or anything.
 - I mean, I guess kind of summing it up,
 then I guess the way that it would interact
 with the Lightning Network
 and the benefit for average users
 would be that it's kind of an upgrade
 to the privacy function that you basically layer
 on top of the Lightning Network.
 Is that right?
 - Yeah, there are multiple benefits.
 First of all, of course, privacy,
 but to be honest, most users won't use it because of privacy.
 That's not what people do.
 But it is a better way to have convenient Lightning.
 Today, we already see that many people are using Lightning
 in a custodial fashion.
 - Yeah, probably most people, right?
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
 And that's my target user group
 because these people can gain more sovereignty
 from using a federated e-cash mint
 that's run by their peers that they know and trust
 because who really trusts Wallet of Satoshi, for example?
 I don't know these guys.
 They might be super awesome and all,
 but I don't know them personally.
 So what basis for trust is there?
 And so that's one thing you solve
 with making the custodial model
 into a more community custodial model.
 Secondly, what's that derives from the custodial model
 is the transactions get cheaper
 and running your note becomes less complicated.
 You don't have to manage channels and all that.
 - And what's Minimint
 and what's the current status of Minimint?
 - Minimint is the first full implementation
 of this federated e-cash system on top of Bitcoin.
 There were previous implementations,
 especially from German cyberpunks,
 Smuggler and Frank Brown called Scrid,
 but they didn't have the Bitcoin backing.
 And so Minimint was the first implementation
 that has both Bitcoin backing
 and federated e-cash in one system.
 And it's currently more or less a prototype.
 Please don't go out there and run it.
 That's not what's intended for right now.
 But I think by end of this year,
 I really hope by October,
 I will be able to run the first test federation
 like for myself mostly just to play around with it,
 which is sufficiently secure that I'm confident enough
 to put some actual Bitcoin in there.
 Because currently testing is only done
 with red test Bitcoin, which are free.
 So there's no problem if some are lost.
 But there's a lot to do to make it secure enough
 and stable enough for the users.
 - So first test it with your own Bitcoin
 and then invite other people to test it with yours.
 >> [LAUGH] Okay.
 So that's, I guess, the big milestone.
 I was going to ask you, what are the big milestones this year,
 given that it's January and we're looking out
 into a brand new year, 2022?
 What are the big milestones in regards to e-cash mints?
 I guess that's the major one that you're looking to hit
 this year.
 Yeah, exactly.
 As I said, getting into a state where
 I'm confident enough to put my own Bitcoin in there,
 that would be awesome.
 And I really hope to achieve this by October,
 because then there's HCPP, the Hacker's Congress
 Colony policy again.
 And last year, I already presented
 a prototype of Minimint there, which was already
 able to pay for copy.
 But I kind of cheated.
 Like, I paid for a Rectus Bitcoin
 and then send it to a Lightning Node on mainnet.
 And the Lightning Node accepted the Rectus Bitcoin
 and still sent out the actual Bitcoin to pay the copy.
 But that's cheating.
 And this time, I want to do it for real.
 And that's my big goal for this year.
 Apart from that, another big goal
 is finding more developers that are
 interested in this concept, that want to work on it.
 Because I'm currently more or less working on it alone.
 And of course, if we can scale up developer involvement,
 then we can make so much quicker progress.
 And I believe this is a super important technology.
 That's why I'm working on it.
 And I hope other people will think so too.
 Yeah, I think that's great.
 And hopefully, we can help drive a little bit more attention
 and get some more people to help you out on the project.
 I was also going to say, you were recently in El Salvador.
 What's kind of your opinion on what's
 going on in El Salvador?
 How did you find that?
 What was the Lightning Network experience like?
 How do you think Bitcoin and Bitcoin usage
 is developing within El Salvador, maybe
 from a payment perspective?
 That was really great.
 Being able to pay for many everyday goods
 just casually with Bitcoin, that's an awesome experience.
 Like everyone who wants to check it out, do so.
 It's just fantastic.
 But we want-- not everything works perfectly.
 For example, everyone who used Shibo Wallet
 and they wanted to receive Bitcoin,
 we first had to figure out how to actually do it.
 Because you have to go through a lot of menus and select,
 oh, I actually want to pay with Lightning
 instead of Shibo.
 And it's not perfect.
 What did you expect?
 They had a few months to roll this out.
 Yeah, that's amazing how fast it came to market.
 Just so amazing.
 In the rest, we probably wouldn't
 have finished all the application processes
 for the contractors by now.
 So it would have taken too much time.
 And they already rolled out a system that kind of works.
 It's not perfect, but it works.
 What else would you say that's not perfect?
 It's just kind of the UI is clunky?
 Or what else did you find not perfect?
 I think the UI and also that people get confused
 if they're using Bitcoin or not.
 Generally, onboarding all the people on the government
 wallets and cyberpunk, I don't like that, to be honest.
 And I wish more people would choose alternative solutions
 like the Bitcoin Beach Wallet, which has a quite similar
 basic idea as the federated e-cash
 that I'm building, just without the privacy.
 They are the community custodial wallet
 that enables people to use Lightning pretty cheaply.
 That's definitely the way to go, in my opinion.
 Yeah, I think that sounds partly like a user issue that
 will probably get better over time
 as people get more familiar with the technology.
 And I think probably it feels globally
 like trends are in our favor.
 And I think that privacy will be more of an issue probably
 going forward.
 And I think that will push more people
 to understand the importance of that kind of concept
 and then also the work that you're doing as well.
 First of all, the user needs to decide
 which federated e-cash mint they want to trust.
 So after they decided that, they need to pack in some Bitcoin.
 Like, it just happens with Liquid,
 you send some Bitcoin to the federation.
 And after that, prove to the federation that you did so.
 And in turn, the federation gives you these IOU tokens
 that you can then just keep for now.
 Like, these IOU tokens are worth a certain amount of Bitcoin
 that was previously sent.
 Now the user might want to pay someone else.
 And for that, there are multiple ways this can happen.
 Like, for example, if they want to pay a Lightning invoice,
 they just use these e-cash tokens,
 give them back to the federation,
 fund a smart contract that incentivizes the Lightning
 gateway to pay the Lightning invoice for them, essentially.
 Or if you are dealing inside the federation with another user,
 you could also just directly give these e-cash tokens back
 because they're just little pieces of--
 essentially, like you can send them a text message. Just give these to another
 user and the user in turn can then go to the Federation, ask the Federation "hey,
 where are these already spent?" because you still have the double spend problem that
 did turn quite elegantly solved. If the Federation says "no, they weren't spent"
 then they can be burned and the recipient receives new tokens in return
 and then they can do whatever they want with these, like the first user who
 already holds some tokens. And in the end, if someone wants to get out of the Federation,
 for example, Lightning Gateway, which also receives these tokens, now needs to
 rebalance some channel, they can take out the eCash tokens and just send them to
 the Federation and the Federation in turn sends them some Bitcoin on-chain.
 Great, so again it sounds a lot like the Liquid Network, right? You pay in and out
 your Bitcoin, you get a Liquid Bitcoin token, you can move that around, do what
 you want with it, or you can convert it back to make Bitcoin, you know, as you feel.
 Yeah, exactly. It's very inspired by Liquid. The main difference is
 instead of putting a blockchain on the Federation, which is inherently
 non-private, or not as private as it could be, like Liquid is already pretty
 good with confidential transactions, but instead building an eCash system on top
 of Federation. That's really powerful because there you have perfect privacy.
 And then the whole setup is faster as well. I mean, this is much more suitable
 for, you know, transactions and commercial kind of payments.
 I think in principle, Liquid could also be quite fast. Like, it's just technical details there.
 So, Federations have some general limitations because, like, all the people
 have to come to consensus. They need some time to send around messages and
 discuss what is actually happening. And with different consensus algorithms,
 with different trade-offs, you get different latencies.
 2021 was a massive year for Bitcoin. I think, like, it surprised in a lot of ways.
 I think El Salvador was a massive surprise. The institutional adoption was a massive surprise.
 And then it feels like 2022 is, there's a lot of things. I mean, the price performance
 has been a little bit disappointing, but the headlines have been, continue to be
 really, really positive in terms of adoption at the sovereign level and the
 institutional level and really, like, at every level, at the retail level,
 the average user level as well. So, looking forward in 2022, what are things
 that really get you excited about Bitcoin? What are you most excited about looking forward?
 Definitely, the price action, what you mentioned, is actually great.
 You can finally concentrate on, like, building again. Like, it's not this crazy
 number go up. It's really distracting, like, even to us developers and researchers.
 Like, you can't imagine the day when Bitcoin goes up, like, 20k or something like that.
 Productivity is ruined. It's just euphoria. But what I'm excited about is, like,
 all these different initiatives building on top of Lightning or on Bitcoin directly,
 that just explore so many different use cases. Like, for example, Wasabi 2.0
 just came out some time ago, and that's also a big privacy improvement.
 Then there's a lot of privacy development happening on Lightning, like,
 rendezvous payments, or they got another name now, I think. But essentially,
 that also the recipient of a payment can stay private. And there's just so much
 research and development going on. I can't even keep track of it all. That's amazing.
 Yeah, it is. It is crazy. I mean, Bitcoin is, it's, there's so much going on,
 it's impossible to be on top of everything, which is very exciting.
 So if people want to work with you or learn more about your work,
 where can they go to find out more about what you're doing and how to contribute?
 I think the best starting point is FettyMint.org. That's where I get, like,
 high-level overview about Fedora Ecash. And there are also a lot of links, for example,
 to the GitHub repository where I developed Minimint, this implementation of Fedora Ecash.
 There's a link to my Twitter account, Eric Sirion. You can probably link this too. And
 they can follow more day-to-day development and some other Bitcoin musings of mine.
 Yeah, and you can also just reach out on Telegram. I had someone reach out to me recently, and I'm
 slowly starting to get them going on Minimint and getting them set up for development. And I hope
 I can get many more people interested like that.
 I think you definitely will. It sounds really interesting. Thanks for
 taking the time for talking to us today.
 Awesome. Thank you for having me on. And see you around.
