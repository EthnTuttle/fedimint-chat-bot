 AI is one of those things where there's absolutely no better solution anywhere in the world than
 Bitcoin. You can think about every single time that I do a GPT-4 or like some sort of more
 advanced model cost, model call, as like every time I send that payment, I'm setting a graphics
 card on fire. You have to pass that cost along to the user, right? And there's no better solution
 for that than Lightning, especially because Lightning has this invoicing system, which
 allows you to do a proof of payment. You're not getting in the way of the user experience for
 this stuff. And at the time that they're incurring the electricity cost, they're passing that cost
 along to the user. The way we sometimes talk about it at Fetty, right, is that we're like bringing
 like some of the oldest technology, which is like community, right, with like some of this newer
 freedom-focused technology, right? And so there's this interesting design space between first-party
 custody and third-party custody of what we call second-party custody. Fetty Mint, the protocol,
 becomes a way of, starts with custodying Bitcoin in a way to scale Bitcoin, where it's very privacy
 focused and it's interoperable with Lightning, right? And then you recognize through the module
 system that you can have it do other things, right? You can make the federation a password
 manager. You can like make a module that like gets hosted access to GPUs and all those kinds
 of things, right? I see a way that we can build this technology if we're backing it with Lightning
 payments, if we're using sort of privacy-focused things as a device for these, where this can just
 like level up humanity. Cody Lowe is the head of developer and product support at Fetty and is
 organizing the new AI for All hackathon happening throughout the month of July. In our conversation,
 we explored the impact that AI will have on content, identity, and payments. We covered L402s
 and why Lightning payments are the best tool for AI companies. And then we got into the work Cody
 and his team are doing at Fetty. If you enjoyed this conversation and if you learned something new,
 the best way that you can show your support is by sending in sats over the Lightning network.
 You can use any podcasting 2.0 app to do that. There are dozens of them out there,
 but my favorite one to use is Fountain. Before we get into today's show, just a quick message
 from our sponsors. Today's show is sponsored by Voltage. Voltage is the premier provider
 of Bitcoin and Lightning node infrastructure. Today's show is also sponsored by Stackwork.
 Stackwork is a Lightning-powered transcription tool that takes the best of AIs and humans to
 create better, faster, and less expensive transcripts. We'll have more from Voltage
 and Stackwork later in the show. Cody, welcome to the show. Thank you for taking the time to
 chat about all things AI, Lightning, Fetty, Bitcoin. We have a lot to cover today, but before
 we do it, why don't we step back and just chat about your background first. Tell me about your
 life prior to Bitcoin and how you got into Bitcoin. Cool. Thanks, Kevin. Yeah. And like long
 time listener of the podcast. So like real honor to be on. I've been here from the very beginning
 with you, like doing the first little fountain sense. It's been a big journey. So I was an
 infantry officer in the Marine Corps. So I still am. I do reserves. I'm like basically finished up
 with reserves, but I was an active duty infantry officer in the Marine Corps. And while I was on
 deployment, we have these very long tactical operation center watches. And so while you're
 there, you can't use your normal, you're in a classified space, so you can't use your normal
 computer. You can't use your normal phone, all those kinds of things. And so while we were there,
 COVID happened. And because COVID happened, there was not a lot happening in terms of
 while we were on these watches. So you had these 12 hour, 24 hour watches where you can't use
 your normal phone and stuff. And so it's kind of an exercise in like, what can I go look at?
 And so there's a couple of things that I found while I was there that led me down into the
 Bitcoin rabbit hole, especially on the development side. So the first one was I figured out you can
 go to bitcoin.org. And while I was there, I'm very, very lucky that one of the first pieces
 that I ended up reading about Bitcoin, I think it was the first formal piece about Bitcoin,
 was the Bitcoin white paper. It's that bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf. I was very, very lucky.
 And for me, when I first read the white paper, I just got it. And I got it kind of from the
 perspective of the energy expenditure aspect for it, where it was like, this is why Bitcoin makes
 sense. And then the next day I tried to read the Ethereum white paper, couldn't get access to it,
 tried to read it outside of when I was not at the talk, couldn't make head or tails of it. I was
 like, hey, maybe I'm just not smart enough to do this. In going down the rabbit hole, you end up
 realizing that like, oh no, Bitcoin is just this very simple, elegant innovation. And that's why
 it's important. And so the other aspect that I did was I figured out how to use Repl.it. And so
 Repl.it is an online coding environment. And so you're normally on these Windows computers. And
 while you're on the Windows computer, you're like stuck in PowerShell. It's very hard to learn how
 to code, all that kind of stuff. I decided to learn how to code because in the Marine Corps,
 we have this philosophy of every Marine a rifleman. So it's like, regardless of what you end up doing,
 you learn that job because insofar as you're in this organization, you exist to support the
 rifleman. So you have to know his job so you know how you can best support him. So coming into
 Bitcoin, like once I start going down the Bitcoin rabbit hole of like, read the white paper, go like
 the rest of Bitcoin.org, right? I decide like, I want to go work in Bitcoin, but I know that the
 most important people in Bitcoin are the developers. And so as I go down there, I say, okay,
 well, I need to become a developer too, just so even if I do something else, I can end up supporting
 them. Right. And so I try to learn how to code while I'm learning how to code. It's like, I'm
 using these Windows computers and it's like really, really difficult. Right. I find Repl.it. Repl.it
 is an in-browser IDE and you can use it on like Internet Edge, which is like the only thing
 authorized on government computers, right? While you're using them. And so while I'm on these long
 watches in the talk during COVID, right, where there's like nothing happening, right? You've got
 like 12 hours, 24 hours at a time where you're just like basically sitting there waiting for the phone
 to ring so you can hop on birds and like fly wherever the crisis is, right? Is that I'm teaching
 myself to code. And so after that, I come out, finish up active duty time, go back to school.
 So I get more of like a formal education with it. Right. And while I'm doing that, I'm continuing
 to have the Bitcoin rabbit hole and like continue just doing like open source lightning development,
 open source Bitcoin development, that sort of stuff. Right. So that's kind of like how I arrived
 into Bitcoin. That's very cool. Were there any other lessons that you picked up in the Marine
 Corps that you then applied to Bitcoin? Yeah. I mean, there's a couple of them, right? So one
 of them is just like the clarifying statement. There's still two clarifying things of like,
 if you don't really know what to do, right. Of that, like the first one is like, it's not about
 you. It's about the Marines. Right. And so just like generally speaking, when you're not sure
 what you should be working on or how you should approach the problem, just like start with,
 it's not about me. Right. So like get the ego out of the way and like continue with what you're
 doing. I find a lot of that in Bitcoin space. And it's super, super, super gratifying to like
 be surrounded by these people. And that's why it's like so cool to work in this space and like
 be surrounded by these devs where nobody puts their ego in the way of Bitcoin. They get that
 this is like a cathedral that we're building. That's going to take hundreds of years. Right.
 And so that's like a huge element of it of just kind of like that. This is more important than me.
 Right. Kind of the other one for it is like when you're faced with incomplete information,
 right. Is that you don't want to get into analysis paralysis. You just want to start moving.
 Right. And I see a lot of that happening now in Bitcoin. Like when there's like this kind of meme
 that's like nothing happens at Bitcoin or whatever. But we've gotten to the point now where
 there's so many people trying different, different things, exploring different design spaces within
 Bitcoin in terms of like Bitcoin script, in terms of what we'll talk about later, FeddyMints in
 terms of like the design space between first party and third party custody of being second party
 custody at different levels along there. Right. In terms of like, OK, well, lightning is going to be
 the kind of waste layer of the hourglass where we're connecting everything between them. Right.
 But like what happens at the lower level? What happens at the higher level? Right. Like that
 sort of stuff is going to change. And so kind of we've got all these questions about Bitcoin and
 how it's going to be useful and how we apply these for these different things. And the solution to
 having all of that uncertainty is to start moving in the direction that looks best to you in order
 to acquire more information. And as you acquire more information, you refine the plan and you
 continue operating. Right. That's kind of like the two things that I first think of. Right.
 Like it's kind of like a cypherpunk, cypherpunk's write code ethos. You know, right. It's like we're
 going to write code to solve our problems. Right. Like if you're not sure what to do,
 just start writing code. Right. Yeah, that's very helpful. I appreciate that.
 OK, I want to start this conversation. We have a few different things to talk about today. We're
 going to go through AI stuff, lightning stuff and Fetty stuff. Let's start with AI, because I think
 this is like the hot topic on the Internet recently. Last, you know, I guess the last six
 months or so. But Bitcoiners, along with everyone else outside of Bitcoin, seem to have very mixed
 views on it, on AI. There are some that say it's, you know, the next great thing. We all need to be
 working on this. There's some that say it's the it's, you know, going to cause the downfall of
 civilization. Right. There's everyone in the middle of that spectrum as well. I want to start
 with your views on AI. You've taken some time to look at this and build on this. Talk to me about
 your views on the AI ecosystem today. Yeah. So the way I kind of like I said,
 right, it's like you solve problems by writing code. Right. It's like 70 percent solution and
 just start continue operating and moving in that direction. Right. Is that I kind of approach it
 the same way that I approach when people kind of have doubts about Bitcoin. Right. It's like you
 sort of chuckle to yourself and you plug in more ASICs and you write more code. Right. And like
 when it comes to the AI aspect of it is that this stuff is open source now. There are sufficient
 numbers of people working on this. This train is not going to stop. Right. We're going to like next
 year, there's going to be open source models which are just as good as GPT-4. Right. Is that this
 train is not going to stop. So skate where the puck is going. Right. And see if we can kind of
 like go in that direction instead of like having negotiations about where the puck currently is.
 Right. So that's kind of like the general framework that I apply for this thing. So how does
 how does I like from working on the Bitcoin development side, how do I arrive at AI. Right.
 So part of it was that basically Repl.it, which was my code editor of choice and like where I've
 been kind of doing this stuff. They did like a big focus on AI. So I was like, OK, now I should
 start paying attention to this. Right. But the way that I kind of think about it, right, is that
 a lot of the stuff that we do in Bitcoin, especially on the Lightning development side,
 is like when you're building for like the Western world, is that a lot of the stuff can feel kind
 of gimmicky. Right. And so that's not that is gimmicky. Right. But it's just like, hey, I could
 do this with dollars. I'm choosing to do it with Bitcoin. There's like certain things where it's
 like clearly Bitcoin makes more sense than dollars. Right. So like cross-border remittances
 and like streaming for streaming sats for payments and like doing for podcasts or doing like Zaps
 and those kinds of things. But it's like, yeah, theoretically, you could also do this with
 dollars. AI is one of those things where there's absolutely no better solution anywhere in the
 world than Bitcoin and they have not solved their monetization problems for it. And so what does
 that mean? Right. Like we've moved into this computing paradigm now with AI where you can
 think about API calls. So like when I go to a website and I start using the AI, that's no longer
 basically free. Right. Is that beforehand you could kind of amortize those costs, like the
 energy costs that you were spending across all of your user base. Right. And so it's like, yeah,
 sure. Ninety percent of my users don't pay. They use the free version, but they're monetized by
 the fact that I get those 10 percent. Right. Who pay me a lot of money. OK. But the problem
 becomes now is that you can think about every single time that I do a GPT for or like some
 sort of more advanced model cost model call as like every time I send that payment, I'm setting
 a graphics card on fire. Right. Like estimates for GPT for car calls are somewhere between like
 three cents and eight cents per per call that you do. Right. So per conversation that you have.
 Right. It's like you can't just open this stuff up to people. And so we're in this new computing
 paradigm. And when you think about it at first, people currently they're trying to use like
 Stripe for it. Right. But it's like, OK, well, now you've just limited your market to basically
 exclusively Western developers. Normally people are going to be using computers or whatever.
 Right. Like skate where the puck is going on this stuff. We've got millions of developers
 are going to be coming from the rest of the world. They're primarily going to be coming
 from mobile. They're also not going to have access to dollars. Right. It's like what's a
 mechanism that you can use to allow them to build, to allow them to use your service as well. Right.
 And this is where Bitcoin comes in, especially like the L4 or two standard rates of health.
 So you've talked about this before in your podcast, but just a summary in case people
 haven't heard of it is that four or two is a reserved status code in the HTTP specification.
 Right. Is that normally when you hit a Web page and it doesn't exist, it'll come back with four
 or four not found. Right. There's a four or four or two payment required error. Right. That's a
 standardized part of the Web. So L4 or two is that, hey, when I send back this four or two
 payment required. Right. I'm saying like, oh, hey, you have to pay for this resource. I pass
 a lightning invoice with that. Right. And then the response is that you've paid the lightning
 invoice and you provide the proof of payment. Right. And so all of a sudden this is like a
 clear match for lightning. Right. Of that, like when you're hitting an API endpoint and the API
 endpoint is going to cost like three to five cents or three to eight cents, like basically
 regardless of who uses it and when you have to pass that cost along to the user. Right. And there's
 no better solution for that than lightning, especially because lightning has this invoicing
 system which allows you to do a proof of payment. Right. And it doesn't get in the way of the user
 flow. Right. So I've been building a bunch of like chat bots and those kinds of things. Right.
 That use lightning on the back end. I'm getting paid in real time and it's not getting in the way
 of the user experience. Right. Because it's a live lightning payment at like. Yeah. So that's
 kind of like the first part. Right. Of that, like you have to be able to pass these costs along to
 the user and then you see some of the development in agents. Right. And so basically you can think
 about AI, like the big generative AI push that everyone's been doing right now is based off
 large language models. Right. And so that one is it's like trained on like the entire compendium
 of human knowledge tokenized and like represented as text basically from being trained on that.
 It can generate just using like prediction what the next parts of the tech should be. Right. So
 it's like based off of the entire compendium of human knowledge and some specific context that
 I give it. And then I ask a question, what is the most likely next token? So next word or next like
 a couple of letters or whatever to do that. And it becomes really, really effective. Right.
 It's that basically you can have it speak to you. Right. And it's very, very smart in the way that
 it does these things. Right. So now the question becomes, OK, well, if we have multiples of these
 language models and we're having them output into each other. Right. Well, now we can basically have
 something that acts as an autonomous agent. Right. And so, like, for example, the first pass that it
 can do when you ask it for something is it can split that task up into subtasks and then assign
 those to different things and say, oh, hey, the best way to solve this would be to use this code
 specific language model. Right. And then feed that task into that one. And then it would say,
 oh, well, he's also asking about like, I don't know, like using Expedia or something. Right.
 So it's like Expedia has been running a model and they have like specific context that's available
 to them. I'll use that one. And so you have like basically the first part of the large language
 models like the like exact like the scheduler. Right. That kind of splits up the tasks and then
 it gives those off to other things. Well, now this is another place where clearly lightning is like a
 perfect use case for this. Right. Of that you basically.
 give these agents that you're spawning lightning wallets.
 And so it can purchase access to resources and stuff as it's working for you.
 And this is like even bigger brain off of this stuff.
 And this is like the thing that really gets me excited about this stuff is that you can
 also train the large language models that you're using to kind of recognize their limitations
 or even just explicitly tell them though by passing them in the context window.
 So basically you can be interacting with one of these models or you can be interacting
 with an agent.
 And as part of the context that you're feeding into it, you can say, tell it what its capabilities
 and limitations are.
 And if you ask it for something that it can't do, it can use the Bitcoin that you gave it
 to get a human to do that part of the task that it wasn't able to do.
 And then feed it back into itself and continue operating.
 So these are just a couple ideas that really got me excited about the applications for
 this.
 And all of these things cost money because in order to do the best, most cutting edge
 stuff, it requires a lot of electricity.
 So basically setting a graphics bonfire every time you do any of these things.
 And the best way to do that is to pass the cost along to the user at the time that they're
 doing it, not try to amortize it across everything else.
 Every single person building on AI is running into exactly this problem and Bitcoin fixes
 this.
 Very cool.
 I love that example you gave of a language model receiving an input and then deciding
 to pass it on to different agents.
 And maybe the agents are human or machines.
 And it reminded me of value for value podcast splits where someone can send in for this
 show, for example, I'm going to get your fountain username or your node ID, and you're going
 to receive sats that listeners send in.
 Fountain's going to get 1%, podcast index gets 1%, I get some, you get some, where every
 sat is funneled through this system.
 And I think that's the same as what you're describing here, where these AI models can
 now, they can pass along information to each other and compensate each other for the work
 they're doing.
 Is that roughly correct?
 Yeah, precisely.
 Right.
 And so what you're talking about there is a prism payment, right?
 It's kind of like the standard that we're trying to talk about it with now within Lightning,
 right?
 Is that like you hit the prism, the prism does the split.
 And so this is a little bit different, right?
 Because you're kind of giving it to, you're giving it to the agent and you're saying,
 "Hey, agent, one of your capabilities is that you have access to this Lightning wallet,
 right?
 And you can make payments up to this amount."
 And so when you do that, right, it can go off and like spawn more of itself, or it can
 spawn like different versions of itself, or it can go purchase access to resources so
 that it can run something more complicated than it's like individually capable of.
 Right.
 But for all of this stuff, right, is that the more important part is that it's happening
 instantly.
 Right.
 And this is why Lightning is the solution for this problem, right?
 Is because Lightning is an instant payment standard for this stuff.
 And so you're not getting in the way of the user experience for this stuff.
 And at the time that they're incurring the electricity cost, they're passing that cost
 along to the user.
 Right.
 And so that's like the big idea here, right?
 Is that like we used to be in this place where it was kind of like, and this is why the fiat
 relationship made sense, right?
 Is that like we used to be able to get in these debt relationships where I could basically
 charge you at the end of the month for this thing.
 Right.
 And the reason why was because I could kind of amortize that across everybody else.
 Right.
 But now it's so expensive and spam is so expensive for this stuff.
 Right.
 Is that like the moment your GPT 4 key gets your GPT, sorry, your open AI API key gets
 compromised.
 Right.
 Somebody is going to pick that thing up and they're going to spam it like to nobody's
 business.
 Right.
 Like there's a huge problem with chargebacks everywhere within here.
 Right.
 So like, hey, my API key got compromised or, hey, this was a spammer who showed up at my
 site, recognized that I was using GPT 4 on the backend and then used it in order to do
 like, I don't know, like generate content for like a model that they themselves were
 training.
 Right.
 Or something like that.
 You can't, it's just so risky right now.
 It's going to be so expensive.
 People wake up the next day and it's like, oh, I have like $20,000 of expenses because
 like some dude figured out I was running the most recent models.
 And so he set my graphics card on fire.
 Right.
 And so this is like, you got to pass this stuff along to the user at the time that they
 use it.
 And then you have the expense to them.
 Right.
 That's really interesting because, you know, chargebacks on the internet have been a thing
 for, I've heard of newsletter writers that for example, some of their biggest costs are
 chargebacks, but they've managed to get by typically because that offsets, that's offset
 by all the people who don't, you know, incur a chargeback.
 But is it just because of the magnitude of the payments and the, just the speed at which
 they're happening, the speed at which all these costs are being incurred that now chargebacks
 are no longer a sufficient user experience to have for the merchants, I guess.
 Yeah.
 So I spend $20,000 and buy a hundred thousand credit cards online.
 I use all of those to register for different AI services.
 Right.
 And then I just span those as much as I can get as much out of them as I can.
 They're incurring this cost at the time that I use it.
 Right.
 And then when they try to charge me for it, right.
 Like I say, Oh, Hey, this was a fraudulent charge or whatever it was.
 That's a $35 chargeback for them as well.
 Right.
 So it's like, not only are they like getting the money, call it back.
 Right.
 It's also cost $30 for instance, that you're doing this.
 Right.
 And so it's just like, what's great about this is because for Lightning, it's a bear
 instrument and you're passing it, you're doing the payment in an irrevocable way.
 Right.
 So again, you could do like a refund or whatever it is.
 Right.
 But it's a push payment.
 Right.
 It's like, I'm paying you at the time that I'm doing the service for you.
 Right.
 And that's incredibly important for, because you could like the paradigm to think in your
 head, right.
 Is that when you're using AI, API calls are no longer free.
 Right.
 They used to be free.
 It used to be like, Hey, I show up at the webpage and like, that's fine.
 I can have millions of people showing up on my webpage because the cost associated with
 somebody just showing up on my webpage is basically nothing.
 Right.
 The cost of training the model, you have to like for the cost of your training, the model,
 all that kind of stuff, you have to amortize that out eventually.
 Right.
 But like, once you have the completed model, think about it as like setting a graphics
 card on fire.
 Every time somebody asks GBT for like, what is Bitcoin?
 Right.
 You have to pass that along to the user at the time that they do it.
 Right.
 Because if they figure out that you're not doing that, then they'll take advantage of
 it and they'll spam it and they'll just use, use it for other things that they're working
 on.
 Right.
 Now, how pervasive are AI models going to be on the internet?
 Like are we at the point now where the internet, we can, we can safely say that moving forward,
 the internet is not going to be a free experience.
 No, I think that there's going to be aspects of it, which absolutely are right.
 Like this monetization model, generally speaking, right.
 Is that like, I mean, for the foreseeable future, right.
 I mean, well, I see a future where eventually everything, content and identity are going
 to be so ubiquitous, right.
 Like Paul eats away from stack work, likes to say, and he's been doing the best work
 on this, right, is that content and identity are about to approach infinity, right.
 Of that you're going to be able to spin up thousands and thousands of agents with thousands
 and thousands of unique identities, right.
 They're going to be able to generate content.
 They're going to be able to generate images.
 They're going to be able to generate videos and writing and all those kinds of things.
 As that approaches infinity, I'm going to need something to get my attention, right.
 Like 99% of the things that I'm going to look at are basically AI generated.
 Like people are already running into this issue in terms of training the diffusion models
 and stuff, right.
 And so the reason why is because there's so much AI generated art right now that when
 you include that in the trading set, it actually degrades the model that you're training on
 that AI generated art, right.
 So there's ways to do it where it's actually like improves it, right.
 So for example, one of the things that people like to do is like, you think about it as
 like a constitution AI, right.
 Of that like, the model gets an input, it makes an output, you feed both of those into
 there and say, this is what I'm trying to get the model to do.
 How would you rate the model as having achieved that thing, right.
 So there's ways that you can actually do this in a like a productive way, right.
 The problem is that it's so it's going to be so ubiquitous, right.
 I mean, there's going to be deep fakes everywhere.
 There's going to be like, it's gonna get crazy, right.
 Is that you need to get your attention in some way.
 And when it comes to that, right.
 So it's like currently, the way that we're in is that, yeah, sure, you've got like the
 web two or what I don't like the web two or three or whatever, right.
 But it's like, yeah, like web two where it's like API calls are free, right.
 And then you have this AI paradigm where you're going to have to pay in order to use the AI
 for these things.
 And eventually, they're going to generate so much content, and they're going to be so
 many agents or whatever, and you're basically not going to be able to distinguish between
 one or the other.
 The only way you're going to be able to distinguish for them is based on payments, right, is kind
 of like a way to think about this.
 So if you're gating content and identity, what are you not gating on the internet?
 What what exists outside of that space?
 That depends, like how can you define something besides its content and the number of people
 who are using it, the people behind it, right.
 And so it's just like, because currently, we're already getting this thing, right.
 So if you look at like, people think talk about them as like since, right, they're like
 agents, basically, that are just these large language models that are just playing off
 each other that you're allowed to like, autonomously just kind of like start operating, just feed
 into each other, right.
 So it's like, it starts with a prompt, it outputs itself, it like feeds those into a
 different thing, right.
 And then it kind of goes back and forth.
 People are already doing this.
 And there's already thousands and thousands and thousands of them, right.
 Like Twitter's been doing more about like spam prevention and stuff.
 But like, eventually, it's just going to be, it's just going to be so ubiquitous that people
 are just doing this all the time, right, of that, like, every single time that you post
 something, there's going to be someone who's going to be like replying back to you or whatever,
 right, is like, you're going to need like using one of these bots, or wanting one of
 these agents, right, is that like, you're going to need a way to get your attention
 for these things, right.
 And there's like a bunch of different ways you could do it, you could do it with reputation,
 you could do it with making like a smaller social circle and stuff like that's kind of
 a lead into like where Feddy comes in and that sort of thing, right.
 But you're going to need a way to get your attention.
 One of the best ways to do that is just purely monetarily, right, is that like, for someone
 to get me to look at something, they pay me a micro payment, right.
 And then like, if I find it valuable, then they get it back and they get more or whatever
 it is, right.
 But that's just like a way to do it.
 And like, the question becomes, can we make this as ubiquitous as possible, right, and
 as easy as possible, right, where like, you don't really notice that it's happening.
 Like, I know you've been using Albi for a long time.
 Albi with WebLN is just like a magical experience when it comes to using these chatbots and
 stuff that I've been working on, right, is that like, there's no friction between what
 the user is doing, but they're getting the cost of specifically the GPT-4 calls and like
 the more expensive API calls passed along to them at runtime, right.
 Now, I have a question about all the biggest companies in AI today.
 So take OpenAI as an example, because everyone's familiar with them.
 Why are they not using Lightning Payments today?
 Because surely they see this same outcome you're describing where there's just like
 an infinite amount of content being created and they are probably running into the issues
 you're describing, you know, about chargebacks, right?
 This is probably a huge issue for them.
 So why are they not already on Lightning?
 Yeah, so this is like a perfect setup, right, for like the hackathon that we're going to
 be running the next month, which is kind of the intersection of Bitcoin and AI, because
 like this vision that I'm talking about, right, where like Bitcoin is the solution to a lot
 of these problems, this is precisely what I've been doing.
 I've been going to all of these AI events because I live in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 This is kind of where all of the AI development is happening, right, is that like, I've been
 going to all these things, I've been telling them this, I'm like, "Hey, like Lightning
 solves this," all this kind of stuff.
 And a lot of them, their response is like, "Show me," right?
 And so that's why we have this hackathon that we're going to be running in the next month,
 right?
 So it's called AI for All, and it's about using Bitcoin as a solution to a lot of these
 problems that we've identified with AI, right?
 And so the idea behind it is that like, okay, let's make a bunch of hackathon projects,
 let's actually start like putting some seed money behind these guys, right?
 So like to have people actually using it, because when you're in meetings with these
 guys, a lot of them say like, "Yes, that sounds great in theory, but I want to see it," right?
 And so at the end of the hackathon, we're going to have a bunch of projects that have
 been using Bitcoin to solve these problems with lightning, with AI, right?
 And so now when we go to these meetings with everybody and they say, "Oh, hey, we're having
 these chargeback problems and stuff," well, here's like a lightning-based marketplace
 for doing reinforcement learning with human feedback, right?
 Like here is a lightning-based mechanism for taking your generated AI content through,
 I don't know, like mid-journey or stable diffusion or whatever it is that you're deciding to
 do or whatever, right?
 Like here's like a working marketplace for those things using lightning or whatever.
 And so when people say, "Show me," we have a suite of products and a suite of like projects
 that people are working on for this stuff, right?
 So that's kind of the idea.
 Very cool.
 And now do you think that imagining that lightning, you build out the showcase of lightning tools
 and show how lightning is able to solve problems for AI companies, the next step there, do
 you think that we also see traditional SaaS businesses, the ones that have been able to
 amortize their costs and deal with chargebacks, do you think we then see them also say, "Hmm,
 maybe lightning can solve our problems too?"
 Yes.
 I think the reason why is because they're going to see it working and they're going
 to see that it solves the problem, right?
 Like this is the big thing when it comes to Bitcoin that like, I mean, I've learned of
 doing development on it, right?
 Of that like a lot of these things is just like when we say Bitcoin fixes this, right?
 Is that a lot of it we talk about like in the abstract, right?
 So when people, I don't know, like a lot of people like to say like, "Hey, Bitcoin fixes
 war," or whatever, right?
 And like, you know, the answer from a lot of people is just like, "That doesn't really
 make sense to me and like show me," right?
 So like show me a war that Bitcoin has stopped.
 And like, well, abstractly and theoretically, yes, eventually, like aligning people's economic
 incentives is like an incentive to lower war and all those kinds of things.
 That's like a multi-year project and all that kind of stuff, right?
 When it comes to this AI stuff, these are current monetization problems that everyone
 is facing within this industry.
 And there is no like established solution for, everyone is in search of a solution,
 right?
 Like, so now is the place where we build this stuff and we say, "Hey, we've solved this
 problem and then nail it and scale it," right?
 Of that like, these are solutions to these problems, show it working, and then everybody
 else comes along afterward, right?
 Like that's kind of like that model that I have in my head of the way that this works,
 right?
 Yeah, 100%.
 I want to get your idea for how big this ecosystem of machine to machine payments is or will
 become in the context of the global economy.
 Like I'm trying to frame this opportunity here and think to myself, "Okay, if we decide
 that Lightning payments are the best solution for AI, what is that impact on a global scale?"
 What are we talking about?
 Like a 0.1% of global economic activity, 1%, 10%?
 Yeah, I'm going to take a page out of Rusty's book here, right?
 So Rusty Russell, he's the lead maintainer of Core Lightning.
 He's worked on Linux development for a very, very long time.
 And one of the things that he said, because there's a lot of analogies between the growth
 of Linux and how Linux ended up winning.
 to the development of Bitcoin and how Bitcoin will end up winning.
 And basically his big takeaway from it is that the things that we think now are probably
 incorrect.
 And so in terms of the percentages that you're going to apply to this, I can see a bunch
 of different arguments for different opportunities.
 Let me just tell you where the puck is going on this thing.
 Is that content and identity are going to approach infinity.
 Is that we're going to be able to create agents that can create their own agents.
 And so when you do a task from your phone or you put something down on a to-do list
 or you signal an intention from your phone, that's going to kick off tens, thousands,
 millions, hundreds of different processes.
 And based on the complexity of those processes, you're going to have to pay for them.
 And so now you think about when you talk about 1% of GDP or those kinds of things, it's like,
 well, if this gets to the point where we've got thousands and thousands of different agents,
 everyone's got a personal agent, everyone's got an agent that's operating at different
 levels.
 They've got a personal agent which can recognize its capabilities and then it forms it out
 to 700 different agents based on the complexity of the task, those kinds of things.
 There's a lot of different ways this can go.
 And so think about the more important thing, right?
 So there's going to be machines operating all the time and they need a mechanism to
 transfer value and lightning is the solution to that problem.
 Do you expect the price to generate these kind of like AI outputs to continue to go
 down over time, to go up over time?
 What's your sense there?
 So an existing model, the cost of doing that will go down, right?
 But there will always be frontier level things, right?
 And to do those frontier level things, to get the most out of the possibilities of this,
 you will have to pay money, right?
 So there will be free options eventually, right?
 Like just I think two days ago, right?
 So Repl.it released a code generation model, like a code focused large language model.
 And just a couple of days ago, somebody was able to get it running just on a CPU without
 even using a GPU, right?
 And so, yeah, so like the first couple of months you needed a GPU in order to do it.
 Then it gets to the point that you can run it on a CPU.
 But by now there have been new models that have come out, right?
 And in order to run those, you do need the GPUs, right?
 And so I think it's kind of a lead into like the Feddy, like federated aspect of this,
 right?
 Of that you can think about like locally on your phone, you're going to have certain capabilities,
 right?
 And that's going to have access to all of your data and all of the things that just
 stay on the phone, right?
 And so when you can't solve the problem, given all of that, you can think about that agent
 or whatever model you're using on your phone, being able to cascade up further and further
 away to more powerful compute resources.
 And the way I would like that to happen is not that you end up giving all of your data
 to these third party people, right?
 The way I think that should happen, I think that that will happen, I'm seeing like stuff
 moving in this direction, is that as you cascade away from yourself, you're stripping out personally
 identifiable information, right?
 So it's like, yes, I'm solving the problem with the more powerful models that cost more,
 that are further away from me.
 But as I move further away from me, I'm stripping out my personal information, right?
 It's kind of the mental model to think about here, right?
 Because currently we're in this paradigm, same thing with like Bitcoin custody, right?
 Where it's like, yes, absolutely.
 Self custody is the best way to do this.
 Most people coming online right now are doing it through a third party custodian and giving
 up all of their privacy, right?
 When it comes to these AI things, right?
 Like yes, absolutely running the thing locally on your computer is like the way to do it.
 And everybody should be doing these things.
 Most developers today, who are, well, over the next couple of years, who are going to
 be coming along, are going to be running on phones.
 They're going to be running on like, you know, old Androids and those kinds of stuff, right?
 They're not going to have access to the best resources just locally on their phone.
 They're going to have to go bubbles up, right?
 Currently the way that that's being solved is give me all of your information, unveil
 all of your privacy, KYC with me so we can use Stripe, right?
 Because that's the current only, basically the only monetization mechanism people have
 right now is like use Stripe, so credit card payments in order to do these payments and
 stuff, right?
 And so as you cascade away from yourself, you strip out the private, personally identifiable
 information, your private information.
 So you use a more powerful model and more of a general way of solving that task.
 And then you cascade it back down.
 It's a way to think about it in my head, right?
 And so, yeah, and so this is like where we're kind of going to, and I'm really excited to
 see what stuff people build as they do this, especially when it comes to like Fetimint
 modules and Fetimods, right?
 Because Fetimint as a second party custody solution and a way that you can take custody
 of like your Bitcoin, your, like your wealth, your data and your digital life, right?
 Is the way to think about it is that like, and these federation levels where it's trusted
 communities that you're, that are kind of pooling resources and are pooling, they're
 doing like second party custody, right?
 Is that at that level, they could also be running more complex models and more advanced
 models and like amortizing the costs across their, just their community.
 Right.
 And so you're not just trusting all of your data and trusting everything to a third party
 custodian, but it's more powerful than just what's running on your phone.
 Right.
 So Fetty can be that second.
 So if your first party is your phone or your hardware wall, whatever second party can be
 Fetimint, some kind of shared community and third party is the custodian or open AI or
 some other, you know, large service that takes all your information.
 Yep, exactly.
 Right.
 And as you're moving further and further away from yourself, you're opting into or opting
 out of levels of privacy, depending on your personal, like basically your personal situation.
 Right.
 So for example, one of the things that like I'm very excited about, right.
 So I'm like, I'm almost done with this, right.
 Is like basically running a model from my phone.
 Right.
 And then when it can recognize that it can't solve the task, then it goes and hits my server.
 Right.
 But at the time that it does that, it strips out anything specifically as it applies to
 the phone.
 Right.
 And so for example, it takes the information and it like routes it such that you can't
 like trace it back to my phone or whatever.
 Right.
 Like I think stuff like that is going to be very, very powerful as we continue on to stuff.
 And that's what I'm really hoping that people start kind of building on and working toward
 as you do this, because, you know, like when people talk about like the dystopian future
 of like, oh, hey, like Fiat, well, it's like AI and Fiat and all those kinds of things
 or whatever.
 It's like, no, like I see a way that we can build this technology if we're backing it
 with lightning payments, if we're using sort of privacy focused things of as it applies
 for these, where this can just like level up humanity.
 Right.
 It's going to be great.
 So I'm very excited for it.
 I hope you're enjoying the show so far.

 Is there precedent for this second party system that you're designing with Feddy in the internet
 already?
 Like what are some examples you can point to of like other instances where someone has
 used this second party approach with success?
 Yeah.
 So there's a couple of elements for it that kind of differ it out in terms of making just
 generally the second party approach or whatever.
 Like the way I kind of think about it in terms of second party approach right now is basically
 what's the best way to tackle this?
 And so like the problem right now for doing second party levels and second party approaches
 when it comes to the internet is like the friction of payments.
 Is that if you want to do payments, if you want to move for that way, then like all of
 a sudden you're like, okay, well now I need to do credit card processing.
 Like the incentives for that become to go to a third party.
 And so like, I think not specifically as it applies to the internet, right.
 But basically like the global South.
 And so within the West, you don't have these like same sort of high trust communities that
 you do down there.
 Right.
 And so they're already doing stuff like pooling access to resources.
 Like for example, like Gridless is doing a ton of really good work of like setting up
 like bootstrapping grids around Bitcoin mining in different parts of the global South.
 Right.
 And so for those ones, it's like, oh, hey, we've got like one place where you can charge
 your phone or one place where you can get access to a computer and those kinds of things.
 And you distribute the resources that you have there as you go across it.
 And you just kind of scale up that concept, right.
 Of that you've got like, okay, this local community that's very high trust that everybody
 kind of knows each other for these things.
 There's like a couple of people who have access to these certain resources and they let other
 people within their community get access to it.
 Right.
 And so that's kind of like the vision for where we're going for this stuff of you're
 saying like, what are like the current analogs for that one?
 I just generally say that because we don't have micro payments in order to coordinate
 and organize those tasking.
 Right.
 So the way that we've seen Confetti Mint is like only just rolling out in terms of like
 the mainnet deployments and those kinds of things.
 Right.
 Is that like, we're going to see this and this is the direction that we're going.
 This is something that people have wanted to do for a very long time.
 Right.
 That's interesting.
 And so I guess even if we can even take a step back and look before the internet and
 we could, we could point to a lot of, and even today, a lot of high trust communities
 that exist in the analog world in the Western world.
 Right.
 A lot of, a lot of small towns you go into, everyone knows your name, everyone, you know,
 they're all familiar with each other.
 Maybe not the case in a large city, but you go to a town with 300 people and everyone
 knows everyone.
 And there there's some kind of like social cohesion there.
 Similar to what we sometimes talk about it at Fetty, right.
 Is that we're like bringing like some of the oldest technology, which is like community,
 right.
 With like some of these newer freedom focused technology.
 Right.
 And so there's this interesting design space between first party custody and third party
 custody of what we call second party custody.
 Right.
 So and that's like kind of where we play in.
 Right.
 And so it applies to like custody in Bitcoin.
 That's what Fetiman originally grew out of.
 Right.
 As like second party custody as a scaling technology for Bitcoin.
 Right.
 But it grew out to much more than that because once you realize, oh, hey, we can do like
 threshold custody of Bitcoin.
 Right.
 Well, you can also do threshold custody of data.
 You can also do threshold hosting of resources.
 Right.
 By gaining access to it through like by getting access to it.
 Okay.
 So there's a lot of really cool opportunities that we're exploring with.
 Do you think all Bitcoin wallets are going to have a data component to them over time?
 They already do.
 Or like an identity component, maybe, or some other.
 You have a clear distinction here.
 You have Bitcoin and then you have like a community or you have data or identity, whatever
 word you want to use.
 Every other Bitcoin wallet today is basically like you store your Bitcoin, you send and
 receive.
 Yeah.
 I think that that's, well, when you think about when you say, hey, you're storing your
 Bitcoin and you send and receive.
 Right.
 So that's like, what are you actually doing is because like to know a private key is to
 own the Bitcoin.
 So when it says you're storing the Bitcoin is you're storing a little piece of data.
 Right.
 Depending on the size of your Bitcoin wallet, right.
 Like it can get bigger, it can get smaller.
 Right.
 It's like from the root, you can generate all sorts of fancy stuff.
 If you're doing like log in with Lightning, for example.
 Right.
 Like the way that that works is that you kind of got a root secret.
 And then whenever you go to a website, uses that root secret to make an ephemeral identity
 that only exists between you and that website that you can't trace across all these other
 things.
 What they're doing is data management.
 Right.
 And so like a couple of things arise with that.
 Right.
 And maybe we can move this over to talking about like first party, third party and like
 second party custody as we do these things.
 Right.
 So it's like first party, you taking custody of your own stuff.
 Absolutely.
 Like the best thing that you can do.
 It's the gold standard at the Bitcoin standard.
 Right.
 But like, that's like the way the way that we should move to.
 But now you think about, OK, well, I have taken self custody.
 My data and my Bitcoin only exist on my one phone.
 Right.
 So it's like, what if I break my phone?
 So it's like, OK, well, now I have to think about backups.
 And so when we think about backups of your Bitcoin, right, the way that we normally recommend
 it is that you do some sort of threshold multi-sig.
 Right.
 And so you've got services like Casa or like Unchained or just what people will roll themselves.
 And they'll say, like, maybe it's like a four of maybe it's like a four of seven multi-sig
 or whatever, or a two of three multi-sig that I've set up, because in the event that I'm
 in an accident or in the event something happens to the place where I'm custodying my things.
 Right.
 Is that like I can't have it stolen from wherever.
 But at that point, you're trusting the other custodians as you go for these things.
 So any the way that I think about it is that any self custody solution resilient to you
 specifically having an accident implies a threshold recovery mechanism that can be made
 outside of yourself.
 Right.
 And so it's at the time that you backed up your cold or that you move your cold storage
 to a threshold vault, which could be met in the event of like you having an accident or
 like, you know, just something happens.
 Right.
 The moment that you do that, you're trusting those people not to coordinate and communicate
 like coordinate against you.
 OK, so any self custody solution resilient to you getting in an accident implies a threshold
 recovery mechanism that can be made outside of yourself.
 And so the way that people currently do that is either like, oh, hey, well, I'm just going
 to trust this guy.
 Right.
 And I will be like, you know, while I have Satoshi or whoever.
 Right.
 And for that one, that's like, OK, well, now I'm just trusting them.
 But they're a third party.
 Right.
 Maybe something happens or something like that.
 Like, let's leverage the fact that we have these high trust communities and that everybody
 like within their local community.
 Right.
 Needs has the same problem to formalize that relationship through the establishment of
 a federation.
 And now once you've set up the federation, OK, well, we're doing this just to custody
 of the Bitcoin.
 OK, what else can we do?
 Like we could do something like password management.
 We can gain access to GPU resources.
 Right.
 So like you have a gaming computer and like you want to like make sure that everybody
 in your community is able to access the GPUs that you have running for it or whatever.
 Right.
 Like that's something that you might end up putting inside of like a FedEmin module.
 Right.
 So like, if you start with Bitcoin, just as like, hey, the data that you're that you're
 custodying at that point is just like the private key.
 Right.
 And you think, OK, well, we're doing all of this formalized infrastructure in order to
 save this piece of data.
 What other data could we also do for this stuff and how are there different ways that
 we could treat it?
 Right.
 So instead of having like a single federation for everything that you do.
 Right.
 You could have like a federation that you run between your family, between like your local
 church community.
 Like I could go to the VA and I could like set one up there or whatever.
 Right.
 So there's going to be different levels of federations for these things.
 And depending on the like data or the amount of money and those kinds of things that you
 want to do, you could put this, you could store that stuff at different points along
 there.
 And now you have a mechanism where it's not just some third party.
 Right.
 It's someone that you trust.
 It's someone that's close to you.
 It's someone that you're much more comfortable with.
 And in the event that something happens to you, for example, you have like a recovery
 mechanism for your kids all like just out of the box.
 Right.
 So do you see this second party approach as a kind of gateway for folks to go from third
 party approaches, which is kind of how they've managed their internet experience for the
 last two decades?
 to a first party approach?
 Like this is like the first step someone might take
 because sometimes I feel like the Bitcoin enthusiasts
 will say to normal folks that are not interested in Bitcoin,
 you should self custody and they go,
 whoa, I don't know what that means.
 I'm scared, I don't wanna try.
 And so is this in your view a kind of like,
 here, take the first step,
 show you how to kind of share custody
 and then you can go branch off on your own
 when you're comfortable.
 - Yeah, so I think the way to think about this, right,
 is that you've got like first party on one side,
 third party on the other,
 and there's this design space of second party in between.
 Right, and that design space
 is gonna be different levels of federations, okay?
 And so I think you're totally right
 in terms of like people being scared
 of the first party custody aspect for it,
 of like, that's why they don't wanna do it.
 But their solution right now is that
 if they don't feel comfortable doing that,
 then they go to third party, right?
 And some people are doing it just 'cause they're scared.
 Right?
 And some people do it because they believe in self custody
 and they've thought about it
 and they've gone through the thoughts of it,
 of just like, okay, well, I believe in this stuff, right?
 But it's not that I don't trust me.
 I don't trust like my direct family
 to be able to do the recovery, for example.
 Like, for example,
 like my wife is completely uninterested in Bitcoin.
 Like she has no, like, she doesn't,
 she's like, Cody, you handle all of that or whatever, right?
 And I'm like, as many times as I've gone through
 like the drills of like, okay,
 this is like something happened to me,
 this is how you recover the coins, right?
 Of that, like, as much as I'd love for her
 to like love Bitcoin as much as I do, right?
 She really doesn't, right?
 And she doesn't want to be concerned
 with all of this data stuff, okay?
 So it's like, yeah, sure.
 Like I, when I first bought my coins,
 I had them in third party.
 I recognize that first party custody is the way to go.
 And so I moved them into first party custody.
 And then you think through, well, okay,
 well now it's just me, right?
 And like something could happen to me.
 So like, I need some sort of threshold backup mechanism
 as we go to these things.
 And so this is like a more technical podcast
 so we can talk about this, right?
 Is that like, you know, like stuff the professor right now
 is that in the event that I do have a threshold
 multi-sig backup situation,
 like what are two of the issues that come into this, right?
 One of them is that now just on a day-to-day spending cash,
 right, is like, I don't have a good mechanism for that.
 Right?
 Is that I need to get signatures.
 If I like really take it seriously
 and I do like a four or seven or something like that, right?
 Then it's like, okay.
 And I'd want it to be Byzantium Voltar, right?
 And so I would probably do like a five or seven
 or whatever, right?
 But like four, so now I don't have
 a day-to-day spending mechanism.
 And so what a lot of people do
 is they'll do their whole cold storage setup
 and then they'll be like, okay, but on a day-to-day basis,
 I just use Wallet of Satoshi, right?
 (laughs)
 That's like one element of it.
 And so you need some sort of mechanism
 in order to do like the day-to-day spending cash
 as well as also do this other one, right?
 But if they do that, right?
 So well now I'm just doing the first party custody problem
 of like the problem that we just identified,
 but it just comes with my day-to-day spending cash.
 Like most of the coins are over here, right?
 But like as Bitcoin goes to infinity, right?
 Like that spending cash will also be very valuable as well.
 Right?
 And so what's cool,
 this is like something conceptual
 to think about with Fetimint, right?
 Is that Fetimint,
 you have this threshold backup mechanism, right?
 Through the Federation,
 but the thing on a day-to-day basis that you're using
 is the e-cash notes, right?
 The e-cash notes are single SIG.
 And so you get the experience
 of using something like Wallet of Satoshi, right?
 But with this out of the box
 embedded threshold backup mechanism.
 So like this, like you can already do this on Feti, right?
 Is that like a day-to-day experience that you use
 while you're using the app,
 like when we were in BTC Prague
 and we did the pop-up Federation,
 this is the experience everyone had there
 where you could just sling sats around, right?
 Through the e-cash notes.
 But in the event that they lost their phone or whatever,
 they can go back to the Federation,
 recover their coins using their recovery material
 or like the, we have like a social backup mechanism
 that we have in Feti, right?
 Where like the Federation can collude
 in order to like help you recover your coins specifically.
 Right?
 - Yeah, I think that's important too.
 I know a lot of people who are hardcore Bitcoiners
 and still use something like Wallet of Satoshi.
 And just because it's like a small amount of money,
 it's not really that meaningful at the moment.
 And there's, Wallet of Satoshi,
 I believe is the most popular wallet.
 I don't mean to say that there's only some people doing this.
 I think there's a lot, you know,
 it's just like the most easy approach.
 And so if you can design that same user experience
 with backups built in, that's incredible.
 - Yeah, well, that's the thing to think about, right?
 Is that like when people first moved to self custody,
 right, they recognize this problem
 that you need to have some sort
 of threshold multi-sig mechanism.
 But there's no good way to do that
 with your day-to-day spending cash.
 And so either they just on one of these two poles right now,
 right, where it's like either it exists on the phone, right?
 It's just a single sig on the phone.
 Maybe they have a backup mechanism or whatever,
 where they took like the backup of the key
 and they like put it in their house or something like that.
 Well, it's like, well, now anybody who recovers that key,
 they own your Bitcoin just as much as you do, right?
 But having like a formalized backup mechanism
 through Fetiment of the on-chain deposits
 when you deposit into the federation,
 those are like the on-chain claims right there
 that require the multi-sig, right?
 But you have the e-cash claims against that,
 which is what you use on a day-to-day basis.
 The e-cash is interoperable with Lightning.
 So the experience is just like using Wallet of Satoshi.
 You're scanning Lightning invoices,
 you're presenting Lightning invoices,
 you're doing an instant payment as you do these things,
 right, but the e-cash payment is single sig.
 And so you, from your phone,
 have the great user experience of this thing.
 In the event that you lose your phone,
 you can do the recovery, right?
 - Yeah.
 Do you think the relationship between one's day-to-day cash
 that they might spend or day-to-day Bitcoin,
 sats, whatever, is gonna be the same as it was offline?
 Where you have maybe most of your money in a bank vault
 or sort of way, you have small amounts of cash,
 but I mean, if you think about it
 in terms of like one's net worth,
 well, it depends on how much your net worth is, I guess,
 but the amount of cash you'd hold
 as day-to-day spending is very tiny.
 Is that same relationship gonna hold true on the internet
 when there's a lot more things you can spend money on?
 - That's specifically what we think is going to happen,
 and that's why we're building Fedi the way that we are,
 right, and so for example, within Fedi, right,
 Fedi is a unified front end for this,
 but the idea behind it is that you can connect
 to multiple federations, right?
 And so you'll have federations operating at different levels
 and the way that you're describing it, right,
 is that like, yes, you will have like the federation,
 which is just you and you're like your closest friends
 and those kinds or like your closest family
 that you're doing for like more of your reserves, right?
 And then on like day-to-day spending or whatever, right,
 maybe you have a federation that's operating
 at like a church group or like the VA or like the city level
 or maybe you're at like a,
 like we just did this in BTC Prague, right,
 is that we had a pop-up federation
 just for the conference, right?
 And so while you're there, right,
 you can have like a really clean experience
 of being able to interact with everybody else.
 You have very good privacy on that side of things
 because FediMint uses the e-cash system.
 And so while you're there, you do all that
 and then when you're done,
 then you pay out of the federation
 or you just do a payment out of it over Lightning, right?
 And so the way that Fedi works, right,
 is that you can very seamlessly move money
 in between these different federations
 that you're doing it, right?
 And so the moment that like, oh, hey,
 I don't feel comfortable having like a million dollars
 in my VA federation or whatever,
 it was like, okay, that's fine,
 like sweep it down into cold storage, right?
 And like my cold storage for this one, right,
 is like a federation of just like my closest family,
 the people that I would do
 with my threshold backup mechanism
 for my cold storage anyway, right?
 - Does Fedi have any competitors today?
 Who do you think of as a competitor?
 - We don't think of people as competitors.
 We think of like complimentary different aspects
 of this ecosystem, right?
 And so it's basically like the place
 that we think is very interesting
 is this second-party design space, right?
 And so a lot of people are building
 a lot of really good self-custody products.
 A lot of people are building
 a very good third-party products, right?
 Fedi is kind of existing in this design space
 between the two of second-party custody, right?
 Where it's recognizing that people have these trusted,
 like high trust communities and relationships
 and leveraging that fact and building off of that fact,
 the fact that like, if you take self-custody
 to its logical conclusion,
 you arrive at some sort of threshold mechanism behind it,
 right?
 And so we're building in that space, right?
 So there's like a lot of people over here.
 There's a lot of people over here.
 I'm sorry, a lot of people in first-party custody,
 a lot of people in third-party custody, right?
 Like we're really focused
 on the second-party custody aspect, right?
 Of like leveraging the trusted relationship.
 - Are there any other Bitcoin startups that have said,
 "Hey, Fedi's doing something cool.
 "Why don't we try and jump?"
 Like, it seems like you guys are truly in a class,
 in a segment of your own right now.
 And I'm trying to just piece together,
 maybe it's just your first mover, or I'm not sure why,
 but it feels like you're in a,
 your own individual kind of like space.
 - Yeah, so on the FediMint,
 so FediMint is the protocol, Fedi is the company, right?
 Fedi is a company building on top of the FediMint protocol.
 We've seen a couple other people who are coming in
 and started building on the FediMint protocol as well,
 like separate from Fedi, right?
 And so like, that's super interesting as well.
 And I'm like, having worked on FediMint
 for like a year before I joined Fedi, right?
 As like, that's very, very exciting, right?
 But, and I just think generally,
 in terms of the way that you're kind of framing it, right?
 Is that it's like, I think you first talked about it,
 of like, oh, hey, like people are gonna go
 from third party to second party, right?
 And like, that was, when we first started talking
 about Fedi, we talked about that, right?
 Like, that's kind of the same way that we think about it,
 right, of that it's like, hey, this is just a design space
 that is underserved right now,
 in terms of there's these very high trust communities
 in the global South, where people are not going
 to have the capacity, for example, to get, sorry,
 they're not gonna have like the supply chains set up
 in order to get them hardware wallets, for example.
 You can't reliably get an untampered hardware wallet
 to like the middle of Nigeria, for example.
 It's like not possible, right?
 And so when you're talking about onboarding millions
 or billions of people onto Bitcoin,
 well, what's a mechanism for us to do this?
 Well, using Fedi, for example,
 so we've got like the FedEye order,
 which is going to be like these trusted community members
 all across the global South,
 and like in most of these high trust communities or whatever
 who can help set up federations.
 Once you've set up a federation,
 well, you can onboard everybody else in the community,
 and it only requires a certain like lower number of people
 versus having an orange pill
 for every single one of them individually, right?
 And so, for example,
 when we set up the BTC Prague Federation, right,
 we had like the federation itself was set up,
 but then every single person who showed up at BTC Prague,
 they were able to join into it.
 And within the FediMint protocol itself,
 there's no concept of the user,
 there's only the e-cash notes, right?
 And so it's just like a very cool scaling solution.
 And when Eric first started building FediMint,
 he thought of it only as a scaling solution
 as it applies to Bitcoin, right?
 And a privacy solution as it applies to Bitcoin.
 Once you start thinking of it more generally of like,
 okay, well, to own Bitcoin is to own data,
 and this is a way of threshold backing up data
 and threshold custody data.
 Well, you can also do other things with that, right?
 That's the way to think about it.
 - You know, it's a really interesting approach to scaling,
 as you mentioned, but also just like onboarding
 and marketing, it's a very,
 if you reach out to leaders of communities
 and then they can do the work
 of tapping into their community for you,
 it's like you have leverage on your marketing team
 or whatever term you wanna use there.
 It's like, you now have people who are gonna market for you
 to bring on other people
 that you otherwise couldn't have reached.
 And so it's like, it's word of mouth on steroids.
 It's really cool, that kind of approach there.
 - Yeah, absolutely.
 And I think what's very important about this too,
 is just like for giving Bitcoiners a tool
 for onboarding other people, right?
 So for example, I think that you've run into this issue
 as well, right?
 Like you understand and appreciate
 the importance of self-custody.
 When people are first coming onto Bitcoin, right?
 Is that like going through the complexities of that,
 especially if they're like more technically minded, right?
 Is like a very, very big investment of time and effort
 on their part and your part, right?
 It's like now through FettyMint and through Fetty,
 is that you can have a federation set up.
 And then when you onboard the person at that federation,
 they out of the box have very good privacy,
 a threshold backup mechanism,
 and they're very close to you in terms of like
 your community for it, right?
 And because it's lightning compatible,
 the moment that they're comfortable with self-custody,
 they can just like move out, right?
 And so that's kind of the big idea.
 - Now, I think you launched the Fetty Alpha
 about a month ago.
 Are there any big lessons you've learned so far
 from the launch to date?
 - Yeah, I mean, like the most exciting part of it, right?
 It was like one of the pop,
 like the pop-up federation that we did in BC, Prague, right?
 'Cause that was just,
 everybody really, really enjoyed that.
 And that was like a really cool like use case
 and just like see it, like see it in public.
 I was like the first time we had like a large mainnet,
 or at least like we'd done a large mainnet federation
 that we were running on Fetty.
 So that was like super, super cool
 to see all that work, right?
 One of the concepts behind it is that we've started working
 on is called Fetty Mods.
 So there's FettyMint modules,
 which are extensions of the FettyMint protocol.
 So like normal Bitcoin transactions
 have inputs and outputs, right?
 And off of that structure,
 we can build all sorts of fancy cool things, right?
 The structure for within FettyMint
 is that you've got inputs, outputs,
 and a single signature,
 which is a cross input signature aggregation
 across all the inputs, right?
 So it's like fancy cryptography
 that we would like to get into Bitcoin, right?
 Because it's much more data efficient
 to have like a single cross input signature aggregation
 for the transaction instead of individual signatures
 for every single one of the inputs, right?
 But based off of this structure within FettyMint,
 you can create FettyMint modules.
 And the FettyMint modules are,
 okay, well, like the out of the box,
 you get e-cash, lightning, Bitcoin, right?
 And so you can have the inputs be Bitcoin,
 the outputs be e-cash,
 the inputs be lightning, the outputs be Bitcoin, right?
 The input be lightning, the output be e-cash or whatever,
 right?
 Well, you can also do other things with that, right?
 You can use this module system to build off transactions
 where you say, okay, well, now the input is lightning,
 the output is execution of a smart contract
 using simplicity, right?
 So we had a module that we may have built last year
 at BTC++ called SimpyMint, right?
 Which was like the first use case of simplicity,
 which is the new scripting language
 that Blockstream has been working on for Bitcoin, right?
 Instead of normal Bitcoin script.
 You could have the input be e-cash
 and the output be an agent that gets kicked off
 and runs on your federation
 in order to like accomplish some tasks
 that you specify or whatever, right?
 So FedEmit has this really, really, really cool module system
 where you can basically do cool stuff
 using the federation as sort of the consensus mechanism
 behind it, right?
 And so within FedE, we have FedE mods.
 FedE mods, like they start off,
 like our first glimpse of that within WebLN,
 sorry, within FedE alpha is basically like using WebLN.
 So like the web lightning standards
 that like you're probably familiar with that Albie uses,
 right, of using them within the app.
 But also this is where we're going with FedE mods
 is being able to get access to the resources
 that you're running within your community, right?
 And so for example,
 when you're navigating through one of these FedE mods,
 right, is that, okay, well, I recognize
 these are the FedEmit modules within the communities
 that you're operating within, right?
 Like I will go try to solve this problem.
 for you while I'm on this page using that instead of just running the local model or
 hitting like the third party.
 And so we've done a little bit of work for that.
 It's very, very early.
 And we're hoping that people are going to start building on it during the hackathon
 that we're hosting this next month.
 But that's something that I'm very, very excited about because we just got to the point where
 on the developer side of things, you can start building your own FettyMods and you can start
 kind of tying it, not just from WebLN, but also tying it into the Fetimid system that
 you're running on.
 Right.
 Okay.
 One more point on Fetty.
 You on your website use the term federated operating system.
 And I, when I think of operating system, I think when a lot of people do, they think
 they're iOS or their Mac OS or Windows or something.
 What is the crossover point between Fetty and those other operating systems, if any?
 Yeah.
 So you think about it by what it does.
 Right.
 So basically, like we started with, right, is that FettyMint, the protocol, becomes a
 way of, starts with custodying Bitcoin and a way to scale Bitcoin where it's very privacy
 focused and it's interoperable with Lightning.
 Right.
 And then you recognize through the module system that you can have it do other things.
 Right.
 You can make the federation a password manager.
 You can make a module that gives hosted access to GPUs and all those kinds of things.
 Right.
 And so the way to think about it is that basically at the operating system level of being able
 to orchestrate your money, your data, your digital life, generally speaking, between
 these different applications.
 Right.
 Fetty is going to be a federated operating system of that.
 You can think about it as orchestrating your data and your money across all of these different
 federated resources.
 Right.
 And so Fetty is the orchestration layer behind this.
 Right.
 And so like I'm going to have Fetty, which is my unified app that I have for my phone,
 and I'll be able to access my multiple different federations and coordinate my resources and
 my money across those ones.
 Right.
 And I can, when I go to a very public federation, like maybe I have a federation that's like,
 I'm operating in a country where they force, I'm operating a country where I'm part of
 a federation where yes, this is like just what I'm doing for work.
 I don't need to do it for my personal life or whatever.
 Right.
 Is that Fetty is going to be making sure that like, as you're operating within that federation,
 you're using the Fetty mods over there or whatever.
 Right.
 It's like not giving anything that's like private that you wouldn't want to put over
 there.
 Right.
 So maybe like the more like more closer federations, right.
 Like the family federations or those kinds of things.
 Right.
 Maybe that's where it's putting the backups for the things as it relates to that stuff
 specifically.
 Right.
 But Fetty is kind of like the orchestration layer, the operating system layer between
 organizing these different federations.
 Does that make sense?
 Yeah.
 Now I think in the Bitcoin community, we've seen a couple examples of things like iOS
 and Android being choke points for limiting access to Bitcoin apps.
 And sometimes it's apps not even related to, you know, Bitcoin storage, but Domus, for
 example, and just being able to zap people and triggering a red flag from Apple.
 What's the solution here for Bitcoiners?
 Where do we go to get Bitcoin stuff through to the billions of people that want to use
 these things without Apple and Google, you know, stepping in anytime they do something
 you don't, we don't like.
 Yeah.
 I'm like, glad you asked because that is exactly what Fetty and FettyMint is solving for.
 Right.
 And so the way you think about it, right, is that for FettyMint, for FettyMint to work,
 it requires a trust assumption.
 You're requiring that the federation is you trust them enough or that they're socially
 close to you enough that you can socially sanction them to not rug you.
 Right.
 Is that like, hey, this is like a four of seven multi-sig or a three of four multi-sig
 or whatever it is.
 Right.
 That is the custodial aspect of it.
 Right.
 And so because that has to be close to you in order to do that, that kind of sets a cap
 to the size of it.
 Right.
 And so what a lot of people say is like, oh, hey, you can't have like a federated solution
 that scales to the whole world.
 And so what Fetty, what we say is that, yes, that's a benefit.
 Right.
 Because you don't want this federation to scale for the whole world.
 You don't want it to become a third party custodian.
 Right.
 You want to keep it close enough to you that you can trust it.
 Right.
 And so what Fetty is doing is saying, OK, there's going to be different degrees of trust
 across these different federations.
 And now let's manage your data and your resources and your Bitcoin across these different ones.
 Right.
 And so it's like as my work federation, as I get like more and more data in there or
 as I like get paid in there or whatever, like I'll sweep it into something closer to myself.
 Right.
 And then like as a federation becomes too big.
 Well, OK, well, now it's a third party custodian.
 It's not a second party custodian anymore.
 Right.
 And so I sweep out of that federation into a different federation, something closer to
 me.
 Right.
 And naturally, hopefully we're going to see hundreds of thousands or millions of these
 different federations that spin up right in different contexts and capacities of anything
 where you've got like a trusted community.
 Right.
 Hmm.
 Interesting.
 Now, I want to also touch on you mentioned Fetty Mint, the protocol and Fetty, the company.
 And you mentioned there's a couple of other developers building on Fetty Mint.
 Can you highlight some of the experiences and ideas that people are building outside
 of Fetty, but on Fetty Mint?
 Yeah, sure.
 So like within like the Fetty Mint development system.
 Right.
 And so within Fetty Mint, like we've been kind of moving toward like kind of formalizing
 like the development process for it.
 And so it used to be kind of hard to set up these federations and all these kinds of things.
 Right.
 But now we've got it very, very clean.
 Right.
 We're basically if you're a coder and you start building with it, you can basically
 start.
 So it's all written in Rust.
 Right.
 And so you can basically start Fetty Mint daemon with default modules and then you just
 add your own module below it.
 Right.
 And so there were a couple of cool hackathon projects.
 Right.
 And so this was like Fetty Mint had a hackathon a little while ago.
 One of the things that they worked on was stability pools.
 Right.
 And so stability pools is basically a way you think about it as like, because you're
 pooling access to these resources and these kinds of things, you have sufficient liquidity
 in order to start doing trading strategies if you wanted to do synthetic dollars.
 Right.
 And so like I said a lot there, I went very fast.
 Like let's kind of talk about this for a sec.
 Right.
 Is that if I can't hold dollars specifically, but I want to be pegged to the price of a
 dollar, what I can do is I can buy Bitcoin and simultaneously short it.
 Right.
 And so for me to do that individually, that requires like a market trade.
 Right.
 The pricing that I'm going to get on that to not like lose a bunch of money as I'm trying
 to like hedge the value of that.
 So they lock in the price of the dollar, the dollar price of those assets.
 Right.
 In order for me to get good execution of that, I need sufficient liquidity and size in order
 to get a market for it.
 Right.
 A market for this trade.
 And so because you're operating these federations where you have like larger amounts of liquidity
 as it applies for these things.
 Right.
 All of a sudden that becomes an interesting place we can start applying some of these
 synthetic dollar strategies.
 Right.
 And so you can use stability pools for synthetically pegging your Bitcoin to like whatever price
 you want.
 Right.
 And so you could like, OK, we want to lock it into US dollars or we want to lock it into,
 I don't know, like euros or something.
 Right.
 And so what's really cool about this.
 So this was like something that was built outside of FedEmit.
 So this is just FedEmit generally.
 Right.
 And then for FedE, like we're planning, like we're doing an integration for it.
 And so experience that you might have of using FedE is just like a lightning wallet.
 But the price denomination that you're operating in most of the time is just dollars.
 Right.
 And so, of course, you can sweep the Bitcoin and all that kind of stuff.
 I know that you've seen Blink, the Bitcoin beach wallet, right, from Galloway.
 Right.
 Kind of that experience where for them, they're using their StableSats software, which is StableSats
 is because what's called because they've got like a larger level liquidity for that one.
 It's like they're using like a threshold multisig, which is like the custodian on behalf on the
 back of the Bitcoin bank.
 Right.
 Because they can do these synthetic dollar trading strategies in order to give people
 a dollar denominated account within their wallet.
 Right.
 And so because FedEmit has these like pooled resources.
 Right.
 You can kind of do the same strategy.
 So that's a very exciting one.
 That was like that was built like I had no idea that it was coming along.
 Like I was doing FedEmit protocol development at the time.
 Right.
 So you can see that show up in the hackathon.
 Very cool.
 So not only can you pool liquidity for this stability pool idea, but then you can also
 pool compute resources for AIs that.
 Yeah.
 Well, that's what I'm very excited for.
 Right.
 Basically, you've got all of these GPU farms set up.
 Right.
 And so if I want to sell access to my GPU farm to like my local community or give them
 like preferential pricing or whatever it is.
 Right.
 Is that like that's something I'm very excited for of that.
 I did like some preliminary work on it for making a FedEmit module that does it where
 basically you've got access to a bunch of GPUs.
 Right.
 And you want to say like, OK, I want to give anybody in my community the ability to use
 these things.
 Right.
 And then the Federation access the consensus layer mechanism for like making sure that
 their API keys that they're using for access to access and remember is distributed across
 the community.
 It's like you don't have any spammers and all that kind of thing.
 Right.
 And so remember what I was talking about.
 Right.
 With when it comes to these AI resources is that you absolutely cannot let somebody spam
 you.
 Right.
 You can't let somebody spam you.
 You can't let somebody instantly incur all of these huge costs for you.
 Right.
 And so like Federation is a very good level of that because there's that level of trust
 in the community.
 Right.
 And so you can say, hey, you're a trusted member of the community.
 I can give you access to these resources that I know you want to use.
 Right.
 Or I can give you preferential access to it or just like the people within the community
 want to give access to the local members of their community.
 Right.
 Like they don't want to have to go sell it to a third party or whatever.
 Right.
 I hope you're enjoying the show so far.

 Okay.
 I want to finish this off with, we were talking about AI at the beginning and you made a point
 about, you know, there's, there's a lot of dystopian views about how this might unfold
 and you had some optimistic views.
 I want you to elaborate on that.
 I want you to help people kind of look around the corner of what's kind of coming down the
 pipeline.
 What's your optimistic view that you have of where the world might head with AI in its,
 you know, current form?
 Yeah, those are very, very big.
 Like the whole world, I don't know about that.
 Right.
 Like I can tell you about like something I'm very, very excited about of that, just kind
 of like a computing paradigm for this stuff.
 Right.
 Is that like, currently there is no monetization mechanism, like established monetization mechanism
 for AI.
 Right.
 It is like in search of a solution for this stuff.
 Okay.
 So we could go down the path that we did for the rest of the internet.
 Right.
 That's probably not the best way to go.
 And it like doesn't work at scale.
 Right.
 Because of the issues that we've identified in terms of like, you're incurring these costs
 at the time that the user does it.
 Right.
 And so you have to be able to pass that along to the user.
 It's very, very difficult to do with something like credit card.
 Right.
 Because of the chargebacks and because of the like the delayed payment is because of the
 fraud and all that kind of thing.
 Right.
 And so the reason why people are going to start adopting Bitcoin as this is because
 of the instant payments aspect of it.
 Right.
 So I'm a developer.
 I host a website.
 I want to pass along this cost to the user at the time they do it.
 The best way to do that is with Lightning.
 Okay.
 It just so happens accidentally that as a sender on Lightning, you achieve almost perfect
 privacy.
 Right.
 As the receiver on Lightning, I don't have very good privacy.
 Right.
 Like I have to tell you where to send the payment.
 Right.
 As the sender on Lightning, you achieve very, very good privacy.
 Okay.
 And so this is another one of these, like, I see you nodding as we kind of do this, right.
 Of that, like the, the reason why they're going to start using this is because of the
 instant payments aspect of it.
 It just so happens that those instant payments have very, very good privacy for the users.
 Right.
 And so now when I set up a new website and I want to give access to like GP, GPU resources
 or like use them as part of my website and those kinds of things, right.
 I don't have to collect all of their credit card information.
 I don't have to know what their names are.
 I don't have to know like how to get like get in contact with them for like a charge
 back or whatever.
 Right.
 It's like they can log in with Lightning.
 It's like, it's just a public key to me and they're passing, like, you're doing the payments
 as they use my resource.
 Right.
 So I'm very, very excited about that.
 It's like, like Alex Gladstein likes to talk about this in terms of like Bitcoin being
 like a Trojan horse for freedom.
 Right.
 Is that like people are going to adopt it because the number go up, but the, like, kind
 of like through the back door, you get all this freedom texts and that sort of thing.
 People are going to adopt Bitcoin as the payment standard for all of these AI stuff because
 of the instant payments aspect of it.
 Right.
 So as a user of one of these services that is offering me like AI services, right, is
 like now this is kind of like the cypher of Pankyto's, right.
 Is that like privacy is not secrecy.
 Privacy is the ability to selectively reveal yourself as part of a transaction.
 Right.
 Is that the base layer of the transaction is that I achieve very, very good privacy.
 You achieve nothing about me, no information about me except for the fact that I paid you.
 Right.
 I can opt into different levels of that.
 Right.
 Just for like user experience and those kinds of things.
 Right.
 So if we do this right, is that the base payments layer for using AI is going to be something
 where you get an instant micro payment.
 So it's better for the recipient.
 Right.
 But also it's very private.
 Right.
 Because it's a lightning payment.
 And so for the user, they get a level of privacy that they didn't previously have.
 So just apply that to everything that happens on the web.
 Right.
 That's kind of like the optimistic view that I have here of that.
 Like now the standard for these things, like the reason why people adopt it is because
 of the instant payment.
 But through the backdoor, you get your users get much better privacy.
 I like that point you made.
 You referenced Alex Gladstein.
 Bitcoin is a Trojan horse for freedom.
 Is AI one level above that?
 We can say AI is a Trojan horse for Bitcoin, which is a Trojan horse for freedom.
 I think I don't know about the Trojan horse analogy as it applies to AI specifically.
 Right.
 But it's like as it applies to the payments for AI.
 Right.
 This is a very important reason to start using Bitcoin.
 Exactly.
 It's like.
 Right.
 And I was talking with a couple other Bitcoin Lightning developers, Bitcoin Lightning developers
 about this stuff.
 Right.
 And it's just like when you talk about them, there's a bunch of stuff that people have
 been doing where it's kind of like, you know, like the way that we sort of think about it
 is like Bitcoin is just money.
 Right.
 And so there's a lot of things that people do with money, which would be better if they
 did with Bitcoin.
 Right.
 And so there's been a lot of building like that.
 But it's like, yes, theoretically, you can do it with dollars and people do do it with
 dollars.
 And so we're kind of just building like a direct competitor for these things like dollars
 have no mechanism for doing any of the stuff that we just talked about.
 Right.
 Like there's no chance that the agents are going to be using dollars in order to pay
 each other.
 Right.
 It's like, you know, it's like you're going to spin up an ephemeral identity for an agent.
 It's going to exist for like 72 seconds as it goes and executes a task or whatever.
 Like, you can't have a chargeback risk as associated with doing that.
 Right?
 Like you need to give it a bearer instrument of lightning.
 You need to have an instant final settlement of these payments.
 Right?
 And so this is one of those things where it's like, for me, it's super, super exciting.
 It's kind of the same thing that I felt when I saw like the streaming stats for podcasts
 and stuff, right?
 Like, like this is something where Bitcoin absolutely fixes it or doesn't require any
 changes to the base layer.
 The tech is ready for it.
 Like, you know what, you've talked a lot on this podcast about like the limitations of
 lightning and stuff or whatever.
 But like on the sender side, privacy lightning is excellent.
 And so for users who want to use AI and do it in a private way, right?
 Doesn't require any changes to lightning, right?
 Is that lightning just becomes like a really cool, empowering layer for this stuff.
 Right?
 Yeah.
 And so that's what I'm very excited about.
 I am too.
 And I think you nailed it when you said that this is something new that the fiat system
 just simply cannot support this.
 And that is where I think a lot of the adoption is going to come from for Bitcoin and lightning
 is where we have no other tools and we want to come up with a new experience.
 And so, you know, I'm very excited about the, you have made me more bullish on AI in the
 last hour and it's opportunity for the world and for, you know, accelerating Bitcoin adoption.
 Because I really think that, you know, if it's so easy to get lulled into using the
 traditional tools that we already have, I think that's why banks and credit cards and
 stuff have, they were the first things people opted for on the internet.
 Because you kind of could get by with them.
 It wasn't ideal.
 It wasn't perfect, but you know, we figured it out and we managed to do it in a half decent
 way.
 You still can't make payments for like under 10 bucks on the internet.
 You can't, you're not buying things for like 24 cents or anything.
 You can't do tiny stuff, but we managed and figured it out.
 But now here's this thing where it's so compute heavy, it's so expensive and it's so instant
 that you can't use the existing rails.
 And so now the first time we're forced to like confront the issue head on and say, we
 need a new solution.
 The old stuff doesn't work.
 Yeah.
 Let me tell you just like a brief story about this.
 Right.
 And so like the way that you kind of framed that, right.
 Of that it was, oh, there wasn't a monetization opportunity.
 And so we decided to go with visa and credit cards and those kinds of things.
 Right.
 Well, just as that was already the traditional monetization of the analog world, it was already
 there and it had already been built up.
 Well, let me know.
 Here's the thing, right.
 Is that originally it hadn't, right.
 As it applies to internet payments specifically, like there's basically no overlap, but I mean
 like there's some tie-ins and all that kind of stuff.
 But conceptually you can kind of think about like internet level payments as like very different
 than analog level payments that people were doing with credit cards and stuff.
 Right.
 And so like, yeah, there's a digital bridge and all that kind of stuff, but let's kind
 of like step this back.
 Right.
 Is that like the original monetization mechanism that they were trying to do with their release
 of windows 95 was they had to deal with digi cash.
 Right.
 So David Chom, the inventor of Chomian e-cash, he was going, he was trying to close a deal
 where they would ship e-cash with every single copy of windows 95.
 Right.
 And so if they had done that, all of a sudden the monetization standard, because they're
 like, Hey, this is the digital payments thing.
 You just accidentally also get very, very good privacy.
 Right.
 And so if that had shipped, if that deal had closed, if they had done that, well then they
 wouldn't have had to go the credit card route.
 Right.
 Like the original one they want to try to do is like, this is basically a digital native
 solution.
 It's not internet native.
 Right.
 But it's like digital native.
 Right.
 They'd already built this out.
 That's what we're going to go with.
 They go with it for the speed of the payments.
 Right.
 But you accidentally get the privacy.
 They couldn't land that.
 And so then they decided to go with the, with the credit card payments.
 Right.
 Well, now the credit cards come around and then the internet takes off.
 And so if you remember like internet commerce between like 2000 and 2010, right.
 And this is mostly like, you know, I was very young at this time.
 Right.
 I think you were young too, but like, you know, you read a little about this history
 for it is that originally before Visa built out its own infrastructure and acquired a
 couple other different companies for it, they were trying to close a deal with DigiCash
 and they were going to use DigiCash for the online payments, right?
 And they couldn't close that deal, but if that deal had closed, well then doing Visa
 transactions would have involved using DigiCash, would have been very, very good privacy on
 behalf of the users.
 And so I see the same thing happening right now as it applies to AI.
 Is that AI is this huge monetization problem that just cannot be served by credit cards,
 right?
 Cannot be served by the fiat system.
 Is that Bitcoin is a match made in heaven for this thing.
 And so it's not about me, like we talked about at the beginning, right?
 Of like, get the ego out of the way, right?
 And like, make sure that we do this as well as we can of demonstrating that yes, Bitcoin
 solves its problems and here's a bunch of ways that we're solving it.
 And for the hackathon that we're doing the next month, we're really excited to see all
 the projects that are going to be doing exactly this thing because it's like the reason why
 they accept it is because you get the instant micro payment, right?
 You just accidentally also get privacy, right?
 You accidentally also use the best money that's ever been created through Bitcoin, right?
 Is that the reason why they're doing it is because they have this serious problem right
 now, right?
 But so just kind of like a little context on that one, right?
 Of that it's like, we had these two opportunities for these payment layers of this new thing
 emerged where they had like software generally run locally on the operating system, right?
 Could have been DigiCash.
 They had internet level payments, right?
 For like Inviso, the way they were going to solve that was with DigiCash, right?
 Or like a deal with David Chauvin in order to use eCash for this stuff, right?
 Let's not like, let's make sure that, you know, like we get the ego out of the way and
 that we're able to deploy this at scale of that people are going to be able to use Bitcoin
 in order to do the instant micro payments.
 And then they backdoor in that like, hey, this is also the best money that's ever been
 created, right?
 Well said.
 I like that.
 On a finishing note, let's do a quick rapid fire round.
 I do this at the end of every show.
 It's the lightning round.
 Are you ready?
 Always.
 Okay.
 You can only hold one asset for the next decade and it cannot be Bitcoin.
 What asset is it?
 Whatever can give me the broadest representation of GPUs.
 So currently I think that's like Nvidia, right?
 But it's something is that I think that we're going to build so many GPUs that it's going
 to boggle the mind.
 Right?
 Interesting.
 What is one book that has changed your view of the world?
 There've been a lot of them, right?
 I think one that's like crazy good is the, which one, which one should I narrow it down
 to?
 I think one, let me just talk about this one, right?
 So one is Gates of Fire, right?
 By Steven Pressfield.
 It's his, I don't know, you're not in your head.
 I don't know if you read it, but I've read, I think he has Art of War or War of Art.
 Which one?
 Yeah, he did the War of Art, right?
 So his, his work that he does, right, is writing historical fiction.
 Right.
 And so the one that he wrote there was the Battle of Thermopylae with the 300 Spartans
 fought against the Persian army, right?
 Like at the hot gates.
 And it is just one of the best, like most beautifully written books ever.
 Right.
 And so that was one of the first ones where I read where I was like blown away by the
 quality of the writing.
 Right.
 But it's also kind of just like seeing the sort of ethos that he goes through that.
 Like one, there's this very long quote about the role of the officer.
 Right.
 And so like coming into the Marine Corps, like that was like a big one for me there
 of like, what does it mean to be an officer?
 What's the difference between like leading guys versus being part of the guys?
 Right.
 So like being in the group versus like, Hey, I'm going to lead the group.
 Right.
 And so there's a couple elements of that in terms of like the primary thing that you're
 trying to do is lead by example.
 Right.
 And so like the most important thing that you can be doing is that when people are uncertain,
 being someone that they can look to and see, okay, this is what we do next.
 Right.
 And kind of like being that prompt of like pushing people in that direction and like
 just saying like, okay, there's a lot of uncertainty right here.
 It's like, we're going to cut through this and start moving in a direction.
 That was like a huge thing for it.
 Right.
 And it's been super helpful for me in terms of all sorts of different stuff.
 Right.
 Because there's like a lot of, that's just like we were talking about before.
 Right.
 And so there's a big incentive for people to just kind of like bicker about like where
 the puck is.
 Right.
 And then like, okay, well like let's just go where the puck is going.
 Right.
 And start moving in that direction.
 And then like rally people to kind of come behind you and start moving in that direction
 as well.
 Right.
 Like that's a huge one.
 Right.
 But like, that's just an unbelievable, unbelievable book.
 Right.
 Like that's one of those ones where people haven't read it.
 Like you should just like stop what you're doing, go read it.
 Right.
 Okay.
 Well, that is my next question.
 If people have one hour and they can stop what they're doing, as soon as they listen
 to this podcast, they can stop and they can spend an hour playing with an AI tool.
 What is the first one you recommend they try?
 I think the coolest ones for just if you only got the one hour or whatever is if you're
 not a coder, try to build a application using Repl.it and Ghostwriter.
 Right.
 And so Repl.it is an in-browser IDE and they basically are doing the most in terms of integrating
 in AI tools.
 Right.
 And they're like, they're pretty huge.
 They're collaborating on us for this hackathon that we're doing in the next month.
 Right.
 And so if you're not a coder, like the way that I think about it, right, is we're talking
 about every Marine or Rifleman, right.
 Is that like the culture I like in Bitcoin is this every Bitcoin or a developer of like
 recognizing that the developers are the most important people within this industry.
 So also taking the time to kind of learn a little bit about what they do.
 It has never been easier to learn how to code.
 Right.
 So it's like, like two and a half years ago, I was just, well, I was an infantry officer
 in the Marine Corps.
 I did not code.
 I was not technical.
 Right.
 And so like by using these tools and by coding a lot myself, just like teaching myself and
 kind of like trying to solve problems by writing code instead of like solve problems by like
 go read about it or something.
 Right.
 You kind of get there better.
 And I can tell you that like I would have gone a hundred thousand times faster.
 Right.
 If I'd had access to chat GPT at the beginning versus only getting access to it, like similar
 has like six months or whatever, like I've grown more as a developer in the last six
 months than I had the entire time previously.
 Right.
 And the reason why is because now you don't have to know all of the underlying technicalities
 behind it.
 Right.
 You just need to get really, really good at expressing yourself.
 Right.
 And so like the way to approach the problem of these AI tools is like, it's getting to
 the point now where it's, it used to be that the model was the problem.
 If you can't get the model to do what you want, you're the problem.
 Right.
 Is the way to think about it.
 Right.
 Is that the reason why this isn't doing what I want is not because it's incapable, but
 because I'm not doing something correctly.
 Right.
 I'm not providing the prompt engineering that I need to.
 I haven't formally thought about this in such a way that I can clearly describe what I want.
 Right.
 And so that's the one of just like, go on chat GPT, sorry, go to, um, replet, try to
 build something with ghostwriter.
 And then rebel is just like a super easy environment to just get like a basic Python app running.
 Right.
 Is that just like, try to do something and like, you'll blow yourself away with how fast
 and easy it is to like code up something that it's like, this is a webpage that does these
 three different things or whatever.
 Right.
 But like going through that exercise and when you come into problems, right.
 Is that think of yourself like the model is not the problem.
 I am the problem.
 Like how can I change what I'm doing in order to get it to do what I want?
 Right.
 I like it.
 And final question for you, who's one person in the Bitcoin lightning or AI ecosystem that
 you'd like to give a shout out to for doing great work?
 Nifty Nye.
 Like Lisa Nugget, 100%, like, like single most important person, like in my development
 as a developer, like ever, right.
 Like she is just like an absolute wizard as it comes to like building and writing things.
 Right.
 But like one of the things that I'm most excited about that she's been working on is base 58.
 Right.
 And that's why I was like helping out with it for the beginning.
 I was part of her first class for it.
 Like I've been encouraging for this as long as I could.
 Right.
 Is because she is like this unbelievable builder and unbelievable coder, but also very, very
 good at teaching.
 Right.
 And so like, I've learned an enormous amount from her, like working with her.
 It's just been an absolute pleasure.
 Right.
 And so like, I think she like anything that we can get Lisa to do of like teaching, building
 those kinds of things or whatever is like good for Bitcoin and what's good for Bitcoin
 is good for everybody.
 Right.
 So like huge shout out there.
 Yeah, that's awesome.
 I've learned a lot from Lisa as well.
 I've had her on the podcast two times and you know, BTC plus plus was great.
 I saw you and Lisa there.
 Before you go, where can people go to learn more about you and kind of follow along with
 your journey?
 Yeah.
 So the big one is that we're doing a giant hackathon next month.
 So like this is probably released right at the beginning of it.
 Right.
 So for the month of July, the hackathons for July.
 Yes.
 So we're doing a hackathon.
 It's going to be focused on this intersection between AI and Bitcoin.
 It's called AI for all.
 Right.
 And so little link in the description for that one, but just sign up for that.
 Start building on it.
 We're going to have tons of people mentoring, even if you don't know how to code.
 Right.
 It's like using these AI tools, like you can build something really, really cool.
 Right.
 And so we want to see that happen.
 We want to like help you out with that.
 So go there.
 And then Feddy is Feddy.xyz.
 Right.
 That's just the website for it.
 And then we're also going to be very active as part of when you're in the hackathon, we'll
 be doing some Feddy stuff in terms of like Feddy mods, how to build a Feddy module, like
 some of the intersections between those ones and stuff.
 Right.
 And then I'm at Cody Lowe on Twitter, but I mostly am going to be for the next month
 at least and probably the foreseeable future after that, I will be in just various dev
 circles building stuff and helping other people build stuff.
 Right.
 So definitely participate in the hackathon.
 Start building.
 Like I said, right.
 I really like this culture.
 It's like starting to emerge within Bitcoin of like every Bitcoin or a developer.
 Right.
 And like AI is a really powerful tool for making that possible because a lot of people,
 they think of themselves as not technical, but they're just not technical yet.
 And they don't need to be as technical as they need it to be because they can be assisted
 by a bunch of these AI models.
 Right.
 Very cool.
 It's a great note to end the show.
 Thank you again for taking the time and I hope we can do it again soon.
 In the last 30 days, you guys sent in 60,730 sats.
 And that came in from 31 different supporters testing a brand new dashboard from Fountain
 right now.
 It looks very sleek.
 Let's run through some of the comments you guys sent in in the last week or so.
 We have a cheers emoji and 250 sats on episode 111 with Graham Krizak.
 Blockchain Boob sent in 5,000 sats and said, great interview.
 Still waiting for that clear net node voltage on the same episode, episode 111.
 Michael Matulev sent in a lightning emoji, sent in 500 sats on that same episode.
 An anonymous user sent 500 sats on episode 102 with Nick Slaney and said, love this episode
 and your work.
 And then we had a user who commented smiles on one of the clips about earning Bitcoin
 for walking.
 That's all the comments in the last week or so.
 Thank you again for everyone who's been supporting the show, sending in sats, sending in comments.
 It means a lot.
 And I can't wait to see what you guys send in this week.
