 Timber.
 Hello there and welcome to the Bitcoin Takeover podcast.
 I am Vlad and my guests here today are two people involved in the fedi project.
 To my right is Obi Nwosu, who is-- are you the CEO?
 Yeah, I'm the CEO, the one who doesn't do anything, just basically smiles a lot.
 He is way underselling himself.
 And you used to be the CEO of Coinfloor, which was the longest standing exchange in the United Kingdom.
 Yes, yeah. I'm sure that crown will be taken over by someone else eventually, considering it stopped.
 But yes, Coinfloor, started in 2013.
 And now you're working on federated Charmian Mints.
 And also we have Eric, who is also known as Sirion, and he likes his anonymity today.
 He looks a bit like Bing from the Batman Christopher Nolan film, except for the sunglasses.
 But it's good to have you, Eric.
 Yeah, thanks. Thanks for having me on.
 So what is your role in the fedi project?
 Right. Like, first of all, the open source project is Fedimint.
 And I started it about one and a half years ago as a pure open source project, researching federated Charmian E-cash.
 And then about one year ago, I met Obi, and he became my biggest supporter.
 He couldn't stop speaking about Fedimint to all kinds of people.
 He expanded my reach by a factor of 100, I guess, or even more.
 I don't know.
 Yeah, so over time, we came up with the idea, I think, after the Freedom Forum, it was, for you,
 to found a company to accelerate our progress with Fedimint.
 And we founded a company, fedi, to which I'm both a co-founder and an advisor day to day.
 I'm still mostly working on the open source Fedimint project as the maintainer and advising fedi
 so we can build the best app that we could possibly build.
 Right. You've answered the follow-up question, which I was about to ask you, which is really great.
 You foreshadowed everything.
 So to people listening who don't know what a Fedimint is, what is this about?
 What is a Charmian Mint, and why does it make sense for scaling Bitcoin?
 Right. Like federated Charmian e-cash mints solve a lot of problems.
 They can solve a lot of different problems for different people.
 And when I began working on it, it was mostly about privacy for me.
 I invented this technology as a way to scale Bitcoin and make it more private.
 But by doing so, you essentially give your Bitcoin custody to a set of people you trust.
 It could be friends or family.
 And they then operate this federated Charmian e-cash mint for you,
 which allows you to spend your Bitcoins without them really knowing what you're spending on, how much you own.
 And when I met Obi, he introduced me to the concept that custody is actually a hard problem for most people.
 I didn't think about it that way, but it makes a lot of sense.
 And since you already have the set of people that you have to trust with your money to use a federated e-cash mint,
 we extended the concept to also include custody.
 And you can use these pre-existing trust relationships to solve the inheritance problem, for example,
 or to solve the backup problem.
 Many people aren't really able to securely backup their Bitcoin seeds.
 And so in short, it solves scalability, privacy and custody.
 And what's really interesting is for me, a year ago when I came to Hacker's Congress,
 I was in the final stages of selling my previous company.
 And I was looking for ways to, one, provide an on-ramp into the Bitcoin ecosystem
 for the majority of the world who still isn't into the Bitcoin ecosystem yet,
 which was an alternative to exchanges.
 And also the people who've already gone the path of custody on exchange,
 giving them a viable solution to take them off exchanges.
 So we already have the option of self-custody.
 But after years of trying and having hundreds of thousands of users and educating them,
 and in some cases begging them to, unlike most exchanges, begging them to self-custody,
 I came to the realization that the only way we're going to get them off exchanges
 is if we can give them a user experience which was faster, better, simpler than using an exchange.
 Now, they needed privacy as well.
 But the normal user doesn't realize they need it until it's too late.
 And so you have to just give them privacy in a way which is invisible to them as well.
 And so when I saw FediMint, I realized that this was a way with a nice front end on it,
 a nice app like you have Lightning Wallet apps or Bitcoin Wallet,
 normal Bitcoin main chain wallets, could give an experience which was that sort of win-win.
 You have privacy by default. You don't have to take any additional extra steps or actions.
 You have incredibly inexpensive intuitive payments because it all says Lightning
 baked into the FediMint protocol.
 And you have an onboarding experience which, in fact, there was one user in the UK
 who I showed them the FlutterMint app, and it was so fast they didn't realize they'd signed up.
 It was how fast it was. Their feedback was, "You've got to make the sign-up process slower,"
 which is an increasing Achilles heel for exchanges.
 The sign-up process can be long and drawn out, and it's only going to get longer as regulation increases.
 Whereas no matter what happens to regulation, the FediMint sign-up process is scanning a QR code.
 I'm very happy to see you excited about FediMint because I saw you a couple of days ago,
 and I was talking to a guy, and you just walked into the conversation and started being so excited
 and talking about federations and how this can help some people.
 But my question to you is right now, there may be critics who say maybe it's easier to get a Swiss bank account or something.
 And how is this different? Maybe not easier.
 Okay, it's more convenient for some people to use a Swiss bank account.
 How do you think that Fedi is better than a Swiss bank account?
 I think if you have, I don't know, the opening costs of a Swiss bank account are,
 and the running costs are, the last time I checked, are several thousand a year.
 And they will, so I would say, at the minimum.
 So I think that's fine if several thousand a year to have a place to store your money is,
 and also you have to trust the Swiss bank accounts that they are going to do what they say they're going to do.
 Because they are someone that you have no pre-existing relationship with.
 I mean, if it's great, if it's your brother or your uncle who owns a Swiss bank account, that would be even better.
 But you've just excluded 99.999% of the world.
 For the other 7.7 billion people, that's not an affordable option.
 So most people, the gold standard, or I like to say the Bitcoin standard of custody,
 is to use first party self-custody.
 But for three reasons, the majority of people, at least today, feel uncomfortable doing that.
 One is they can't afford it, and that's why they wouldn't take the Swiss,
 they will also not be able to afford the Swiss bank account option.
 Or they feel it's too technical, it's like servicing your own car.
 Do you do that, or do you give it to someone else?
 Most people, although it's much less complex to do self-custody in Bitcoin,
 still, there is a technical level which people feel uncomfortable with.
 Or because of years of being educated in how to have a relationship with money,
 people are afraid as well, and we can't underestimate that.
 Now that's something, hopefully, over time, through education,
 which is a big part of the FEDI, the FEDI organization's remit,
 we can make people become more comfortable with the idea of self-custody.
 And also, over time, if we give them access to a currency, a money like Bitcoin,
 that doesn't have inflation baked in, people can build wealth,
 so they can, again, start to afford it as well.
 And then from the technical point of view,
 hundreds of companies around the world are working at making self-custody easier.
 So I'm hopeful that that percentage of people,
 through education, technological and UX advancements,
 and gaining wealth through storing value in Bitcoin,
 more and more people will be comfortable with first-party custody.
 But today, right now, for human rights defenders and members of civil society,
 or people who are living in the global South,
 the vast majority of people are just not there.

 Three days ago here at the Parallel Nepalese,
 there was the first ever transaction with a purchase
 using Fedimint and it was Eric who made it.
 I saw that on Twitter and I felt super proud
 that I would come here and meet him in person.
 So how did that go?
 How does it work technically?
 Because you made that payment on the Lightning Network.
 Yeah, exactly.
 First of all, this coffee tasted like 10 times better
 than every other coffee I ever had.
 It was the success of one and a half years of work.
 And not only my work, but together with a lot of great
 other developers that joined the project recently.
 So yeah, how it works is you have these e-cash tokens,
 we call them, or like you can imagine them
 like bearer certificates.
 That's what Smuggler likes to call them.
 And these are little pieces of data you can hand around.
 Like you can just give a piece of data to someone else
 and they can redeem it for real Bitcoin.
 So what we do is we give--
 these pieces of data to a so-called Lightning Gateway.
 The Lightning Gateway is incentivized then to make a payment on behalf of you.
 That's how I bought the coffee there.
 I told the Lightning Gateway,
 "Please pay this invoice for me and I will give you these e-cash tokens."
 Then there's some smart contracting magic going on inside
 the federation that only pays
 the Lightning Gateway if it actually does the payment for me,
 otherwise I get a refund.
 >> At this point, I think it's useful to ask about
 the distinction between FEDI and FEDIMINT and all the other federations,
 because you guys only develop the code,
 but there are others who run the federations.
 Sure.
 >> So I think Eric mentioned it before.
 So there's FEDIMINT, which is the open-source protocol.
 Eric is the lead maintainer of FEDIMINT,
 and there's this incredible group of
 open-source engineers and developers working on that.
 FEDI is a commercial organization that's being set up to do two things.
 One is to work really,
 really hard to make sure that
 the FEDIMINT protocol is successful and rolled out to as many people as possible.
 We do that through the creation of the FEDI app,
 and then just promoting FEDIMINT and FEDI.
 But the other thing is,
 what we realize is custody is the foundation of financial ecosystem.
 So there are many other,
 and you've seen it here in Hacker's Congress,
 many other Bitcoin companies and technologies that are really good.
 As a whole, provide a suite of solutions to many of people's day-to-day requirements,
 for wherever they are in the world.
 Some optimized for a certain use case or a certain country, some more general.
 So FEDI effectively can be,
 but these organizations tend to be highly technical.
 So they build great technology,
 but they're not necessarily good at getting it out there and getting people to use it,
 especially in the global South and LATAM, etc.
 But by the nature of what we're doing in the community-based structure,
 we're in a great position to take FEDI as a base,
 but also educate people about the entire ecosystem of options,
 and effectively be the outsource marketing and sales in
 the global South and worldwide for many aspects of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
 So that's what FEDI focuses on.
 We have three parts for FEDI.
 One is code, which is the app.
 All of the heavy lifting is done by FEDIMINT,
 but the app itself provides a beautiful interface on that.
 Then it's collaborations.
 We work with other companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
 Instead of trying to do everything ourselves,
 we find the best people in the space,
 and we try to find ways in which we can work together with them.
 Then finally is coaching.
 We have people on the ground and within our app,
 where we're constantly educating people to become better Bitcoiners,
 have better sound financial management,
 protect themselves from scams, and so on.
 Also educate them about ways in which they can solve
 their everyday problems using the tools that already exist as well.
 That's FEDI, the organization.
 >> I appreciate the answer.
 I also want to ask you technically,
 how does it work when you move Bitcoins from the main chain to FEDI,
 or from Lightning to FEDI?
 Is there a time lock that happens?
 >> First of all, you move your Bitcoin to a specific FEDIMINT instance,
 like a specific federation.
 You determine which federation it should be,
 like by who you trust essentially.
 If Paul was running a federation themselves here,
 then I would probably trust them and move
 my Bitcoin or some of my Bitcoin to their federation.
 How that works is they essentially have a multi-sig wallet.
 If they have four people running the federation,
 four guardians we call them,
 then I would deposit some Bitcoin to their multi-sig wallet.
 Once it's confirmed, then they will issue
 e-cash tokens in return and I will get them,
 and then can use them for example to incentivize
 the so-called Lightning Gateway to pay Lightning invoices for me,
 or just send it around inside the federation.
 There are no time locks involved really.
 You have to trust this set of guardians to not steal your money.
 You don't have any recourse if they do.
 It's not like a smart contract really on chain that would protect you in that case.
 So you really have to have these second party relationships already.
 I think that's a powerful technology because of that,
 because most people already have these trust relationships.
 I mean, I often used to call it my Bitcoin family when I come here.
 I meet so many great people again.
 If there was a federation of four or seven people from Paladin policy,
 I would totally trust them.
 >> Yeah. I'm going to get to that, to the trust issue.
 It's important to understand the trade-offs because FedE has scalability.
 Actually, let's talk about scalability before we talk about the trade-offs.
 There's this metric in the industry which tends
 to overestimate the importance of transactions per second.
 In terms of scalability,
 how many transactions can a FedE Mint handle?
 >> That mostly depends on the hardware it's running on actually.
 So we did some testing and we could totally
 support about the same throughput as Bitcoin already has per federation.
 Each time you create a new federation,
 you add one time the Bitcoin throughput to the whole network again.
 You can do this over and over and over
 because Bitcoin has a relatively large capacity.
 If you only have to make one or two deposits to a federation to set it up,
 and then everything else happens via lightning,
 then you could set up thousands of federations that way,
 and you scale Bitcoin by orders of magnitude.
 So the system is quite scalable,
 and even if you needed more throughput,
 you could do this with better hardware.
 I'm talking about Raspberry Pis right now.
 But ideally, if you wanted more throughput,
 you could invest in some better hardware.
 But on the other hand, you don't want federations to become too big
 because then you don't have these trust relationships anymore.
 So it's actually good if there are some scaling limitations that forces
 people to choose more local options, more trusted options.
 The great thing is, since we have
 the lightning integration you mentioned previously,
 we can just interact between these federations.
 If there's a federation in Parallelopolis,
 I think that's in Slovakia,
 and then one federation in Parallelopolis,
 and I go over there to visit them,
 then I can totally just transact with them
 using my Parallelopolis federation here.
 So that's also a great superpower,
 like lightning is the settlement network for us.
 >> Yeah, that's a good answer.
 Another question that I have,
 does it use any kind of blockchain,
 and what is the confirmation time for a transaction?
 >> There is no blockchain.
 Like we have a similar--
 >> So it's like lightning from this point of view.
 You also lock your coins, you have a different token minted,
 and you transact it on that second layer.
 >> Yes, kind of, yeah.
 Like the technology internally is wildly different from lightning.
 Like the special plant signatures we use in the Chowmin e-cash,
 like that's a whole different technology.
 But yeah, there isn't a blockchain,
 you don't have to sync any data as a user,
 and that makes it way more scalable for light clients.
 Like if I have a phone,
 I only really care about my own e-cash tokens,
 like my own bearer certificates that I get that way.
 And like I don't have to validate
 all the transactions of all the other people,
 so it's localized in a way.
 And yeah, that makes it quite scalable actually.
 >> So what you offer as advantages is great scalability,
 depending on your hardware.
 You have very good privacy,
 as you don't know who's transacting and which amounts.
 >> Yes, like you don't know whenever the transaction happens,
 like who initiated it or who received it.
 Like with amounts, it's a little bit more difficult,
 like you can split up the amounts,
 so we don't see that the single transaction
 had a certain amount.
 But when you, for example, want to pay lightning invoice,
 then typically you will leak the amount, unfortunately,
 unless, like until there's a fix for that on lightning.
 We cannot work around that,
 because we use lightning as our settlement layer.
 But internally in the federation, you have great privacy.
 And yeah, if you don't know who is sending the transaction,
 like does the amount really matter?
 That's the question.
 >> But the only trade off is that you need to trust
 the people who run the federation,
 or you can become a member of the federation.
 >> Yeah, like you definitely have to trust the people
 that run the federation, but not every single one of them.
 You need to trust them as a whole,
 like that they will not conspire against you.
 Like actually, if there was a federation
 where the guardians don't really trust each other,
 that might actually be a good option,
 because then they have a harder time conspiring against you,
 because they will not know if,
 like if they have the coordination problem,
 like the Byzantine generals problem, essentially,
 between each other when they want to conspire against you,
 because one of them might want to take your money,
 but they don't know if they will propose this action
 to the others, if they will comply,
 or if they will let them out.
 So, yeah, if a majority of them was malicious,
 they could take your money, but you assume,
 like you know them, you trust them,
 they're your friends, your family,
 like they will not do this, right?
 >> Yeah, but the good news is that
 they don't know how much money you have.
 >> Yeah, exactly.
 >> Because it would be easier to conspire
 if they saw how much money you have in your wallet.
 >> Yeah, like they cannot see what the single user
 has in their wallet, but they see
 what the federation total owns, like that's--
 >> Yeah, so if it's a small federation,
 I guess they can talk to each other
 and figure out how much each one of them owns,
 and by exclusion determine who's the whale
 in that federation?
 >> Yeah, so one rule is, rule of thumb is,
 if you are like orders of magnitude more wealthy
 in a federation, then you should maybe
 take some money off the federation.
 Like generally, it's not a wise idea to be like the whale.
 >> So, yeah, and this is, you have the same problem
 if you use an exchange, or a bank,
 you'll have the same problem.
 The difference is, and this is where Fedi app comes in,
 we think it's important to not just assume
 people can figure these things out,
 or point them towards a number of books
 about good financial management and literacy or courses,
 but within the app itself, we will over time
 add more and more things like this
 to remind people about these things,
 and potentially the app could be monitoring,
 'cause the total amount in the federation
 is visible on the blockchain, it's multi-sig,
 and the app will know your balance,
 so if the amount you're holding
 becomes quite a large percentage of the total,
 it can say, hmm, you've got quite a large percentage
 of the total, maybe you should split it
 between more than one federation,
 'cause you could be a member of more than one federation,
 or maybe you've got quite a large amount full stop,
 so you should consider self-custodying now,
 because it now makes financial sense for you to do it,
 and by the way, we have a network of people,
 this is in the future, we have a network of people
 around the world who we've contracted
 to help their local communities,
 effectively provide local customer support,
 and so we can put you in contact with someone
 who can help you set up a federation for yourself,
 or help you give you advice on how to get
 into first party custody when you're ready.
 So our objective is to, as I said,
 not just to make an incredible, simple-to-use app,
 but win by helping the entire Bitcoin community win,
 'cause in combination, Bitcoin today
 is either at the point, or almost at the point,
 where as a suite of solutions,
 we can help most people in most circumstances,
 it's just that the information is not readily apparent
 and available and surfaced,
 and that's what we're hoping to do,
 make that more clear,
 and help and educate people through that.
 - Yeah, if Bitcoin wins, everyone wins,
 and we want to make this happen, so.
 - No, I understand this is mostly for people
 who would otherwise end up on exchanges,
 and it's a way better option?
 - Exactly, yeah.
 - Or there's people who,
 or there's people who are,
 even if you're self-custodying,
 it can be useful in that case,
 and you have a large amount of Bitcoin
 to make that make sense,
 it can still be useful to put some of your Bitcoin in this,
 that you use as spending money,
 because this spending experience will be simpler,
 and you get automatic privacy
 without having to take a number of additional steps.
 - And many people are doing this already,
 like when you look at how most people use Lightning,
 they typically use custodial services,
 like either Wallet of Satoshi,
 Blue Wallet is often used in a custodial way,
 or Ellen Bits, that's also a self-hosted option,
 which is quite nice,
 so you can already have this community banking
 kind of thing going on,
 but what they all lack is privacy,
 'cause when you have a custodial solution,
 maybe you don't want them to know
 how much you actually own,
 how much you're spending,
 and that's one thing that FedElement can fix.
 - And you also have,
 also, if the custodial,
 there's potential risk of challenges withdrawing now,
 that risk can happen in a FedElement,
 but it would have to happen collectively
 for the entire Mint,
 you cannot forensically choose you as a user,
 we're going to prevent,
 you have to prevent everybody,
 which makes it a much bigger ask.
 - There is essentially this triangle,
 which is inspired by Zucco's triangle,
 which he made in the 90s,
 and it's adapted,
 now we call it a trilemma of decentralization,
 security, and what's the other one, scalability,
 and FedE is scalable,
 is secure,
 but the decentralization is subjective to the federation,
 it depends on how it's set up,
 and how they establish these relations
 between themselves,
 but I want to ask you about censorship resistance,
 let's say that for some odd reason,
 FedEments get outlawed in some countries,
 and they come and confiscate the hardware,
 I mean, the police raid your house,
 they take the hardware in which the federation is run,
 what happens in that situation?
 Are the funds lost,
 or can the members of the federation
 who have their money there do something?
 - It depends,
 the federation is a multi-sig wallet,
 and for example,
 if you have a five out of seven federation,
 then as long as less than,
 less or equal to two of the guardians get confiscated,
 then everything can continue as before,
 like you can withdraw your money,
 and you should probably do so,
 if there was already action taken against the federation,
 and you could also maybe try to migrate
 to a better jurisdiction,
 if they manage to confiscate more of the guardians,
 then first of all,
 they cannot move the money at first,
 like if they only managed to confiscate
 like four out of seven,
 then they cannot move any money,
 like police cannot take the money.
 but neither can the users.
 So that's kind of a problem.
 No party can take the Bitcoin, and in the worst case,
 they get burned.
 If they manage to complicate all of them,
 then police could take the money.
 But we could look into some interesting schemes
 where if no movement of funds happens
 in a certain amount of time, then
 step by step the requirement for how many signatures to spend
 you need goes down.
 I think that's also what Doxium's Liquid is doing.
 There is a backup path.
 If funds don't move in a certain amount of time,
 then you have a 2 out of 3 multisig
 instead of the 11 out of 15.
 And you could have such backup paths
 and just enforce that the funds are regularly moved.
 That might be a precaution you want to take
 in really risky situations.
 But we haven't looked into this yet.
 It's still an open research problem.
 And there are many of these.
 For any developer that's listening,
 it's a very interesting project.
 We have many open questions still.
 And please just check out Fedimint on GitHub,
 github.com/Fedimint/Fedimint.
 And we will be welcoming you with open arms
 and always need more help there.
 Obi, I've heard you describe this backup scenario where
 you take a picture of yourself or a video with voice.
 And that's going to be basically your seed phrase.
 How does that work?
 Yeah, so I'll describe the idea at a high level.
 Video and so on is an implementation detail.
 It can be implemented in many ways.
 But because you already have a number of high integrity,
 community focused, and reliable people
 who are selected to be guardians,
 you have an opportunity to do backup, to back up effectively
 your private key, which you normally
 would on any other wallet create a 12 word or 24 word
 phrase, seed phrase, which you can use too,
 which is basically an alternative representation
 of that private key.
 And then you have to figure out yourself how you back that up
 securely.
 And that is, for many people, one
 of the technical complexities that
 prevent them from wanting to use first party custody.
 And it's not a-- it seems like a simple problem.
 But actually, when you get into the details of it,
 it's actually not so simple.
 What you can do in a Fedimint scenario is, as a user,
 you can-- and if your app and the Fedi app will support
 this, then it can be done in an automated way.
 Your app and you as a user can choose
 to take your private key, break it up into parts,
 cryptographically sharding, and then take those parts,
 the number of parts equaling the number of guardians,
 and give it to the number of guardians.
 Now again, with a mobile app or wallet,
 this could be done with pretty much a click of a button.
 You then need to have some mechanism
 to add almost like a name tag, like in a code check,
 so that you can come back at a later stage
 and the guardians can find your codes, find your shard.
 And there are different ways in which we're
 looking at doing that.
 But we want them to all be quite intuitive.
 And that's what I was referring to with one example.
 It's like a selfie, for example.
 But if you lose your phone or you lose your device
 and you join the Federation again,
 you can go back to the guardians,
 give them your name tag, your identifier.
 They can find the shard.
 And after verifying that you are who they say you are,
 and they can do that using what I like to call KYF.
 We normally have KYC, Know Your Customer.
 But this is Know Your Friend, Know Your Family,
 which is even stronger.
 And so they will identify you the way
 they normally identify you, just by knowing you.
 And once they realize it is you, they send back their shard.
 Once a majority of users send back their shard to you,
 you can reconstruct your private key, and away you go.
 Now, there are certain implementation details
 and improvements to that simplified form.
 For example, before you give them the shard,
 we would look to encrypt the shard so
 that they can't collude to reconstruct it
 without that encryption.
 And there will be a user experience
 to make sure that that whole process is as simple
 and as slick and as easy to use as possible,
 given the focus of it being something that
 is non-darting to a global, multi-billion person audience.
 And that's an example of something beautiful,
 what happened here.
 I would have never come up with this technology.
 We were just discussing, and Obi had this background
 as an exchange operator.
 He knew what users want.
 And I just had this idea of this private federation thingy,
 and was all nerding out about it, explaining it to him.
 And he noticed, OK, wait, we can actually
 use this for custody, for restoring users' funds.
 And then he asked me a lot of questions,
 like, how could we do this?
 And it was really intense.
 We had a great conversation.
 I think multiple months we figured this out.
 And that's how beautiful things happen.
 You need multiple people with different skills
 and different backgrounds.
 And that's also why I really like this conference here,
 because it brought us together.
 And otherwise, it would never have been that big.
 So this is the first conference that Fedi has sponsored.
 We've just been busy talking about it
 and getting the word about Fedimint out.
 But when Eric suggested that we sponsor Hackers Congress,
 I was like, absolutely.
 Because this is where we can-- if it wasn't for Hackers
 Congress, Fedimint-- well, Fedimint would still exist.
 But I wouldn't have found this solution
 to a problem I've been looking for, which I think could help.
 And it can help billions around the world.
 We wouldn't have set up Fedi.
 It just wouldn't be here.
 And I think when we look at this back over the coming years,
 we're going to see that this is going
 to help billions of people over the coming years.
 And it would have all started because of events.
 So we had to come back and show our gratitude for everybody
 here.
 If somebody wants to use a Fedimint wallet today
 to make their first payment, what is a good option?
 What's the best one that they can find right now?
 Right now, we only have really one mobile wallet
 that's already kind of pre-released.
 And it's called FlutterMint.
 And that's what we presented here at the Hackers Congress.
 How do you spell that?
 FlutterMint?
 Flutter.
 F-L-U-T-T-E-R.
 Oh, Flutter.
 Yeah, like the mobile framework, essentially.
 Maybe you can hold it into the camera.
 It's a really cool app.
 Future Paul, Paul Miller, and Justin Moon built it.
 And I'm super grateful.
 Because otherwise, people would have no way, no easy way
 to interact with FediMint.
 And we could demonstrate it here.
 People bought a lot of coffees, a lot of Martes
 with FlutterMint already.
 If people came to our workshop room, we set them up,
 gave them some free sets.
 Even if something goes wrong, I don't
 want to feel bad about it.
 But yeah, it worked phenomenally well.
 It exceeded all my expectations.
 It was just beautiful to see.
 Now, to be clear, it's not what you
 would consider this consumer-grade app
 with education and help and also having
 a backing of on-the-ground technical support
 to support it and so on.
 But it's still-- it is a FediMint-capable app.
 And it shows you the power.
 If you use it, you can sign up literally in a second
 by scanning a QR code of the Federation.
 And you're there.
 And you can receive some Bitcoin.
 In the conference, we give you the money to buy coffee.
 But you can receive it from any Lightning wallet,
 whether they're within the Federation or outside.
 It just looks like a Lightning experience.
 Behind the scenes, the FediMint protocol
 handles all the magic.
 But it provides a nice interface to that,
 a nice, clean, simple interface.
 What if you have a Raspberry Pi or a laptop
 that you're not using?
 And you want to set up a Federation, what does it take?
 Right now, it takes some technical expertise,
 because you need to set up services to run permanently.
 You have to run software 24/7, essentially.
 But we want to integrate with a lot of these node packages.
 And that will allow people to trivially deploy FediMints.
 And we are currently working on some steps
 towards that goal.
 And probably end of year, beginning next year,
 we'll try to get some first federations going
 and be more public.
 This was just a demonstration, just a test internally here.
 We're not that ready yet.
 But it felt great already.
 So I'm really looking forward to seeing this technology
 deployed to the real world.
 Now, I wish you best of luck with the project.
 And my last question for you is, how can people
 follow you and the project?
 You as in you the person, and then also the project.
 Yeah, like the project has @FediMint, a Twitter account.
 And I have the @EricSerion account.
 And I think when you look at the FediMint Twitter account,
 you will see a bunch of stuff from me retweeted.
 So I don't have to spell it out.
 And Obi has the OG Twitter handle.
 So yeah, because I am showing my age.
 But I have @Obi, which is my name, Obi.
 I think it's just--
 and I'm even shorter than Jack, because he's four letters.
 But NVK has another three letter Twitter handle.
 Both of us are old guys now.
 And also Fedi, because I'm CEO of Fedi,
 has the @FediBTC on Twitter.
 And our website is Fedi.xyz.
 There's also the GitHub.
 Yeah, like FediMint GitHub is github.com/Fedimint.
 And then you will find a bunch of repositories,
 the main one being FediMint.
 And the Fedimint.org is a website
 dedicated to the FediMint protocol project.
 Right.
 If you want to learn more about FediMint, the protocol,
 then go to Fedimint.org.
 We have beautiful videos, beautiful graphics.
 A huge shout out to Pete Winn, who built all of that.
 And I'm super grateful.
 Now we can actually explain it to people in simple terms,
 and not just my tech gibberish.
 It's a beautiful website that really explains it.
 And if you want to know more about Fedi, the organization,
 and our objective to hyperbitcoinize the world,
 then you go to Fedi.xyz.
 So Fedimint.org and Fedi.xyz?
 Yes, exactly.
 FediMint.org, yes.
 Yes.
 OK, so thank you guys.
 And I hope I'll see you with greater success and more
 wallets and federations and stuff.
 Absolutely.
 It was a pleasure.
 Thank you.
