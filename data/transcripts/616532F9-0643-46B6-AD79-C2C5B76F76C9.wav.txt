 On today's episode, we've got on the founder and CEO of CoinFloor.co.uk.
 And this is Obi Nwosu.
 Welcome to the show.
 Thank you very much for having me.
 Awesome, man. It's a pleasure.
 So people won't know this, but I'm going to be straight up front and I'm going to
 say that we recorded an entire podcast yesterday.
 It was an incredible conversation.
 And then I realized that my sound was coming through the complete wrong
 microphone. It was coming through my laptop mic rather than my proper microphone.
 So my audio was garbage.
 So I had to reach back out to Obi and he very graciously was happy to rerecord this
 conversation. So that's just a little bit of background info there.
 So we're going to go over some of the same things we did before that you never heard.
 And we're also going to go over some new things as well today.
 But Obi, for people who are not familiar with you, introduce yourself to the people.
 So, yeah, it was it was an amazing conversation.
 I hope that we do it justice.
 Probably one of the best conversations I've had in a long time.
 So anyway, my name is Obi Noisu and I am the CEO and co-founder of CoinFloor.
 And CoinFloor is the UK's longest running Bitcoin exchange.
 So quite simply, we allow people to buy and sell Bitcoin for mainly pounds, but also
 dollars and euro.
 And we try to make buying Bitcoin easy.
 Our history and my history, because it's heavily intertwined, goes back seven years
 now. As I said, 2013 was when we launched.
 And my introduction to Bitcoin actually happened in 2011.
 As a background on myself, I'm a Anglogerian, conceived in Nigeria, born in the UK
 in London. So my mother made it to England and then combat rolled down.
 Down the stairs into Heathrow Airport.
 Grew up in a council estate in West London.
 West is best in some things, in other things, not so much.
 And yeah, I experienced all aspects of life from partying or from playing on the street
 and being spat at as a kid to working in some of the fastest growing e-commerce
 startups in Europe.
 And what was your childhood like growing up in London?
 What was your experience like?
 It was interesting. There were multiple sides to my experience.
 So on one side, I had a, by Nigerian standards, very liberal parents, but by
 Western, by the standards of my Western mates, very, very strict parents.
 So they taught and ensured that I worked hard, I studied and I understood the value of
 education and effort.
 My mother was one of the hardest working people you could ever know.
 My father is an incredibly intellectually gifted guy and probably an argumentation
 expert. I don't think anybody, I can never recall anyone winning an argument.
 Even if he doesn't know about the subject, he'll still win the argument.
 And so that side led me to work hard and study, etc.
 On the other side, I experienced the experience of many other people, Black people
 growing up in inner city London on a council estate.
 So you would experience racism, you would experience prejudice.
 But you would also form incredible friendships and relationships as a result as
 well. And it would harden the diamond, as I like to say.
 Yeah. I was actually going to say, how do you think those sort of experiences shaped
 you in terms of what you've gone on to do now and all of the success that you have
 achieved? I mean, you're very much a leader in what you do.
 You're progressing forward.
 Yeah, no, absolutely. I give props where props are due.
 And to come from that situation, a lot of people come from that situation and it can
 often go to very polar opposite different ways.
 Some people will use that as like rocket fuel and motivation to go forward and strive
 and achieve and prove to people and show people, hey, look, you can come from here and
 you can still succeed, whereas other people sort of embrace more of a victim type of
 mentality. And they use that as a permanent alibi or a permanent excuse or reason as to
 why they're not achieving or why they're not successful.
 So what do you think it is that set you apart in that regard?
 Yeah, so it's a really interesting one.
 One thing is you mentioned that a lot of people used to prove that they can succeed in
 advance. And I'd like to think about that question from a different angle in the sense
 that why do we have to prove anything?
 Some people who come from other backgrounds basically have the privilege to not have to
 prove anything to anybody.
 Sure. And we do live in a world where that is important.
 Now, this is the reality.
 And so I do realize that wherever I go, I am an ambassador for an entire group of people
 without realizing it. And I have that extra responsibility, that extra overhead that
 other people don't have to have.
 If I was a woman as well, I'm not, you may not realize, but I'm not.
 But I'd imagine that they'll have to prove that they'll have this extra overhead of
 proving certain that they don't conform to certain negative stereotypes about themselves,
 which is an extra overhead and impediment that other people don't have.
 But it is the reality of the world.
 And that's where we live.
 However, for me personally, I have a high level view that I can't put an exact
 percentage, but I guess in the high 90s or definitely over 90 percent of what I've
 achieved in my life has nothing to do with me.
 This is a very counter, this is an uncommon viewpoint.
 But I but again, I tend to think that if you just think about it for a moment, it's
 pretty obvious. I did not control where I was born.
 I did not control that I was born able-bodied and healthy.
 I did not control that I was born male.
 I did not control that I just scraped above six foot tall, which again gives you another
 advantage and many other things, which when you think about that are probably far more
 important in terms of my success than my own personal effort.
 I believe I work really, really hard and I believe that from myself internally, but
 also a number of people have told me that over my life, which validates it as well.
 But I am pretty sure that a disabled girl in poverty stricken part of Calcutta who
 works a hundred times harder than me is unlikely to get anywhere near to my level
 of success, which evidences the fact that vast majority of my success has got nothing to
 do with me.
 Now, within that 10%, that's where there's a flex.
 And I have put in a lot of effort over that time.
 And that's but I always try to remain humble.
 Yeah.
 But what I do think is that that period of time that that allowed me to work as hard as
 I do, I can go back through time and remember that when I was a teenager, something
 happened. And I think most people go through this point where they make a decision as
 to whether they're going to let reality push them or let or push reality.
 And I, they're going to the master of fate or they're going to or they're going to
 believe that fate is the ruler and they're just part of the story.
 Now--
 Well, I believe again, an element of luck happens here because you make this decision
 generally in your teenage years, because your emotions are at 110%, you're going through
 puberty, et cetera.
 And even relatively small things in retrospect seem huge.
 It could have been, I asked some girl on a date and she said, "No."
 And I mean, the sky was falling and I thought, "The world will end tomorrow."
 I can't remember exactly what it was, but at some point I made this decision about the
 world.
 And it could very well be that I made a decision to go the right direction and have a more
 of a sort of solution focused positive mindset.
 Because at that time, the preponderance, the majority of things happening to me were positive.
 And I realized at that time, I could have also easily gone the other way if the people
 around me, my relationships and my family had a very different mindset.
 Yeah, no, I think that's correct.
 I mean, I think an interesting thing in the way different people view the world is always
 the nature versus nurture debate, the individuality versus the system and the environment.
 And I think anyone sensible recognizes that both of these things, all of these things
 play a factor.
 But I think one thing that shapes people's worldviews a lot is, I guess, how much percentage
 they give to each one.
 So sort of in my own worldview, I sort of feel like you're downplaying your own role
 in this.
 So in my view, I think that 90/10 might be might be swapped around.
 I understand the perspective because I think certainly from, you know, if people want to
 talk about privilege, I mean, I think the most obvious privileges would be, say, Western
 or being born into developed country privilege, as you sort of already alluded to being born
 in the UK rather than in India or lots of other countries.
 I think a big one is chronological, right?
 Being born in the 1970s or 1980s or 1990s or 2000s rather than the 1500s or the 1200s
 or whatever BC.
 I think those are those are massive factors.
 Of course, having having a stable family coming from a two parent household, etc.
 I think those are probably not probably I think those are actually much bigger privileges
 if someone wants to call them that, then the things that people tend to focus on, such
 as gender or race or sexuality, etc.
 I'm aware all of these things can come with different advantages and disadvantages in
 different areas, different places, different regions, different activities, etc.
 But yeah, I mean, if I look at the world, if I look at people in it, even if I just
 look at the UK, there are, you know, realistically, there are there are millions of people who
 have a similar background to any of us, really.
 And where those people end up, I do believe is sure, there's a luck component once you
 once you're beyond the sort of dint of birth aspect.
 But I do really think it comes down to people's mindset and their actions and their and their
 choices.
 And I think, yeah, for some people, it's going to be easier than others in certain
 ways.
 For some people, it's going to be harder.
 But I do believe and you know, I think this is an optimistic belief.
 And I think it's an empowering belief to think that, look, even if someone comes from,
 you know, a bad position on on all of these things, technically, if they're in a if they're
 in a free society that does have opportunity, you know, in some some places, you know, kind
 of no chance, unless you can get out of there, you're not going to rise.
 But I do think in the UK, in the USA, and countries like that, at least in the modern
 world, everybody does have that opportunity to rise.
 So that's kind of my own perspective on that.
 So I agree with a lot of what you say.
 There are things that I disagree with.
 I think though, one of them is a premise, which is if there's a condition of that, which
 if it existed, I would completely agree with if we live in a free society.
 But I think that the reality is we don't live in a free meritocratic society.
 And that and that is the fundamental flaw.
 And if we did, then all of those things would be true.
 I also think right at the beginning, we talked about nature versus nurture.
 But all the things you discussed weren't either nature or nurture.
 So nature, nature is what you're genetically born with.
 And I personally also agree that that's a small, I don't, you don't know the percentage,
 but my own personal views is a very small percentage of it.
 Nurture is, you know, the people who you grew up with and what they said to you and how
 they helped you and the family, etc.
 But where you were born, your ethnicity, your gender have got nothing to do with nature
 or nurture.
 In a way, they don't.
 That's to do with discrimination.
 People discriminate based on those things, but they don't affect the quality of your
 argumentation.
 They don't affect which, but the people around you, you grew up with would.
 They don't affect the quality of your thinking.
 They don't affect how hard you work.
 But even then, even with all of that, if you can, they do affect your ability to live in
 a fair society.
 So my, having thought about this and experienced this through my life, my view is you have
 to work with what we've got, but we have to also be pragmatic and try to improve this
 environment so we can get closer to a meritocratic world.
 And my general view is you're not going to find the meritocratic world in the physical
 world.
 You're going to have to find that in, in just like, you know, people were having a bad lot
 in the UK.
 They decided to go to the new world in the US or New Zealand or so on to discover better
 places where they could start a new and former world in the way they wants to be.
 The equivalent of that would be to go, if you're really, if you're really ultra wealthy,
 you might try to do an Elon Musk and go to Mars, form your own economy and currency and
 so on.
 But it's a much simpler solution.
 You go into cyberspace.
 This is where all the growth in businesses or the growth in industry, it removes disadvantages
 based on location.
 You are able to transact with people, especially with technologies like Bitcoin and so on,
 pseudonymously or anonymously.
 So in those environments, and we've already seen studies are showing in markets where
 all the parties are anonymous to each other or at least pseudonymous, that customer service
 levels go up, quality of product goes up, and the people who succeed come from every
 background.
 So there is a demographic mix which actually fits the world.
 And that's the only place on the planet where that happens.
 Why is that?
 Because there is no mechanism to discriminate.
 And that's why I'm really excited about this explosion of things happening over the last,
 even in the last six months with coronavirus, remote working, VR, and of course, Bitcoin
 that are leading to this more meritocratic world.
 In summary, as we move towards anonymity, we move towards meritocracy.
 That's a really interesting take.
 I mean, you're actually the only person I've ever spoken to who views it from that perspective.
 I hear a lot of people talk about, you know, VR and Bitcoin and different types of technology,
 but coming from it from the angle of wanting to essentially eliminate any forms of unfair
 prejudices or biases or discrimination, I think that's a really interesting perspective.
 Do you have any fears or concerns about how that will affect our humanity, for lack of
 a better term?
 Because I'm very interested in, you know, virtual reality.
 I'm interested in artificial intelligence, the future.
 I'm someone who does spend a lot of time online.
 You know, I'm very well known on social media and all that.
 So I obviously embrace it to a degree, but I'm also honestly the idea of like living
 in a primarily virtual world where I'm no longer me and you are no longer you, essentially,
 at least in terms of what we're seeing and what we're hearing.
 There's something about that that I can't articulate it perfectly, but there's something
 about that that like really disturbs me actually, and sort of freaks me out.
 I don't know if you share any of those concerns.
 I share those concerns, but I tend to think that anything that scares me suggests that
 you're doing something useful and interesting.
 I mean, I studied computer science and cognitive science in university, so basically AI.
 I was trying to build our new robot overlords.
 And one part of sort of computation theory is there's something called Shannon's information
 theory, which basically says that the less common an idea or a piece of information is,
 the more valuable it is.
 And we can see statistically, looking at all information created, that the uncommon ideas
 are the valuable ideas, and the common ideas and the common view is less valuable.
 And that helps us in multiple different ways.
 Can you explain that a little, because that doesn't sound intuitive to me.
 So, let's, okay.
 So for example, let's take a document and you want to, if you want to try to have a
 program go through the document to work out what to, to summarize the document and find
 the important stuff and summarize the document.
 If you look at the frequency of a word and you order it by frequency, and then sort of
 focus around summarizing the bits around the, which are less frequent, you will find, you'll
 get the most effective summary.
 So I think that was going to be very common in a document.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 They're not really useful to you understanding that document, but Corona virus, or maybe
 we may not be able to say that.
 You know, I have things like flossing, Nessie, no heli, pedification, you know, the longest
 word in the UK dictionary. If that existed in that document for some reason.
 you probably want to sort of look around that part of the text because
 you're probably talking about something that's uncommon and therefore
 interesting. Okay. So, um, so that's an example.
 Okay. So do you, do you mean from,
 you mean from a computational perspective rather than from a societal
 perspective?
 But I think that if it's in life in general,
 I always try to feel that if my thoughts,
 if my idea seems to make logical sense and it's an uncommon idea,
 it might be an interesting insight that's worthy of attention.
 So the fact that you're not, many other people are saying it for me is a tick,
 that I'm probably onto something because the stats and data sort of supports it
 and not, and it's an uncommon view. Okay. But yes,
 it does scare me, but it's still going to be inevitable just because it scares me.
 Doesn't stop. It doesn't stop. Stop it from happening. We can look,
 we can see the advance of, of the internet.
 Most commerce is moving online.
 Most entertainment is moving online. Most marketing is moving online.
 The network effects of transacting in a digital world far outstrip
 those of the physical world. So we know that where this story is definitely going.
 And so now we can either get in early if you're a first mover,
 if you're one of those, um, you know, um,
 first settlers in the new world and you got there early,
 then you are going to benefit.
 If you got to Manhattan Island when it was still arable land,
 only a couple of hundred years ago, when land was very inexpensive,
 you'll be doing your family would be doing very well right now. Um,
 and Bitcoin land and cyberspace right now,
 our new world is basically flat lands and open wide
 plains with, with very few,
 with very few obstructions and no one yet really interested
 in to any great degree. And so the opportunity right now,
 and it's only a once in a, in a, in a, in a generational opportunity is,
 is amazing, but it's also very scary. But, and we have to accept in this world,
 we will be transacting and living and, and,
 and beyond the point of waking up to the point we sleep, we,
 we already are what, what percentage of your time do you now in remote work,
 land spend online versus spending,
 interacting in the physical world. If you take out, going to the toilet,
 which I don't really think people think of when they think of living
 or washing their teeth. Yes, they are alive, but it's just sort of,
 you're on autopilot mode. So if you're asleep, going to the toilet,
 eating just, just for the sake of fuel or, or, or, um,
 you know, performing your other sanitary duties,
 what percentage of your life are you not living in a digital world right now?
 Yeah. At this, at this moment in time, given these lockdowns,
 then it's a high percentage for myself and for, for a lot of people.
 Definitely.
 Well, so, and even, even after this, and,
 and this is a key thing about the lockdown it's causing to play,
 it's causing to put into place and the, the, the, the,
 the biological weapon that caused this to start, I won't,
 it's, it's causing to accelerate a number of changes that are irreversible.
 So we will find a solution to this biological weapon,
 I'm sure in the fullness of time, um, or I hope,
 but even if we do, um,
 we have now dispelled the myth that for example, um,
 you cannot work as an organization effectively, um, remotely.
 I know organizations that had tens of thousands of employees for
 over a decade,
 their brightest minds have said it was impossible for them to remote work.
 And then within two weeks, they had 40% remote working.
 And within four, within four weeks,
 they had 70% of their workforce remote working when it was supposed to be
 impossible. Um, so this is an irreversible change.
 VR and people interacting in VR in a, in a,
 in an easy and powerful way is an irreversible change.
 Once you see the power and it goes on and on and on.
 Wow. And, um, what sort of, what sort of timeline do you see for,
 what kind of, what kind of timeline do you see for VR?
 Cause one thing I think is super interesting is, you know, with,
 in my own lifedime, certainly, I mean,
 I'm 33 and seeing the technological change in
 progress within my own lifedime has been fascinating, right?
 I think sort of people of around my age and generation have
 probably seen the sort of the,
 the quickest and most significant changes in technology,
 whether you're looking at computer graphics or mobile phone technology
 and the internet going from, you know, like I'm, I'm still relatively young,
 but I can remember when it was, you know,
 dial up internet and it's all really slow.
 It takes hours and hours to even download a song, you can't do streaming,
 et cetera. And then in a very quick, a very short space of time,
 we've got broadband.
 We're able to do things like what we're doing right now.
 And it keeps getting faster. You can even do it on mobile without wifi. Um,
 look at social media and smartphones. I mean, when was the iPhone invented?
 Was it 2000 and about 2005 or so roughly?
 I was checking this the other day. Um,
 the keynote speech on the iPhone was, um, 2007,
 2007. Okay. And then she was checking it. Yeah. Facebook, Facebook,
 Twitter, and iPhone all came out, um, within,
 within about three years of each other. Yeah. Yeah. So I,
 so I was on Facebook super early. I was on Facebook in 2004,
 as soon as it opened up to my university when,
 when it was still just limited to certain universities. So from, I mean,
 2004 is not that it's, it's not really that long ago.
 So just to think from 2004 to 2020 social, you know,
 if you said social, yeah,
 if you said social media or smartphone or iPhone to someone in 2004,
 they'd sort of give you a blank stare unless maybe they were on my space. But,
 um, the speed at which it's gone to the fact that, you know,
 everybody has a mobile phone, probably anyone listening to this,
 if you're not listening to it on your phone,
 I can almost guarantee that your phone is within arm's reach right now.
 And everyone has one. Even if you go to developing countries, everybody,
 everybody has a mobile phone. People are connected. It's online.
 And it's now almost hard to remember how people used to do
 everything beforehand. So what I do often wonder is, okay,
 in 10 or 15 years from now in 2035,
 what's going to be that technology or those technologies,
 which are just totally integrated into our lives and our lifestyles and our
 business, et cetera, that right now,
 we can't even sort of fathom how much we're going to be
 using them and depending on them, et cetera.
 And I assume you think VR is one of those.
 I, and I spent, I mean, so, um,
 just background computer science, AI,
 but I also spend a lot of time doing, um, um,
 graphics development as well in, in, in, um, university has gone. Um,
 I built one of the world's first multiplayer games back
 in the late 1990s, um, still has a million users. And, um,
 the last job working for someone else before I became an entrepreneur myself,
 um, over 10 years ago was building a massively multiplayer virtual world.
 We created a virtual currency before Bitcoin. I was like 30 million users.
 So I actually have a lot of experience of building games,
 but I stopped playing games around 12 or 13 years ago because post
 like there was a game called doom and quake, um, post that every other game that,
 that, that existed off in my mind was basically the same thing with slightly
 better graphics. Um, and I was waiting for,
 I'd seen us move from text-based games when I was in, was in,
 in, um, um, primary school. Um, and so it's, um,
 secondary school and primary school playing these really basic games on these
 early IBMs.
 And then I saw 2d games like Pac-Man and Shinobi and double dragon.
 And then I saw us move to 3d and that was another major move.
 And then it's just basically been 3d and for, for a long period of time.
 And it was really clear. The next one, the next stage, you'll go from 3d to,
 we know if you just look at sci-fi,
 it tells you what the next stage is going to be.
 And the next stage is ready player one is the matrix is it's so crash.
 You, you're able to enter these virtual cyber space.
 So this is what we needed to have next.
 Now when Oculus first came out with their Kickstarter project, um,
 I was, I bought one of these initial initial development kits because it wasn't
 ready. I've had the daydream cardboard VR,
 I've had the daydream view and all of these things. It's not ready.
 And then, um,
 a few months ago I put on an Oculus quest expecting it not to be ready and we
 have minimum viable products.
 It's the same with the iPhone and mobile phones. Um, I,
 I had the original Nokia's that had like two hour battery life and,
 and I had the Motorola movie, um, phone, or isn't,
 it was a Nokia as well from, um, from the matrix, which,
 I had blackberries, I had everything,
 but even though I'm not a big fan of iPhones, I did, I, when,
 when that keynote speech by, uh, by, um, Steve jobs came out with the iPhone,
 that's when I realized we created,
 we finally created a computer in your pocket, which was the dream for, you know,
 the star Trek sort of communicates the device had now been created with the
 Oculus quest. It was still janky. It only had 12 apps for the first year.
 You couldn't have anything more than 12 apps.
 And there was all these problems, slow battery life.
 But we knew that we'd finally figured out the right form factor.
 Now that's happened with the Oculus quest.
 And after we'd figured it out all over human innovation and ingenuity can now
 focus instead of going in scattergun to make it the ideal experience.
 And if you look at what's happened, even in the last year in VR,
 you'll be astounded. They're looking at holographic. Um,
 I just looking yesterday, um, Oculus just released two days ago, a, uh, a,
 um, some of their research and literally it is the sunglasses,
 um, headsets, which looks like normal sunglasses, but it's really high quality,
 high field of view VR.
 They're showing and demonstrating with high color gamut better than a normal
 screen. Cause it uses folded holograms.
 and it literally stopped out of VR.
 Normally they need a lens that needs to be a certain distance away from your eye, which
 is why they're so big.
 But what they did is they've created a hologram of the lens.
 So it's like, it's literally sci-fi.
 It's like inception, you know, type stuff.
 And that's in a period of the year they've advanced an incredible amount.
 So when you're looking at time horizons, back to your original question, and you look at
 the history of innovation, we can see it's increasing at this exponential rate.
 So many futurists, they tend to end up being hired by Facebook to work at Oculus for some
 reason, or Google.
 But many futurists have in different ways come to a date of 2030, which is the point
 where we reach this almost technological singularity.
 I don't know if it's going to be 2030, but if you extrapolate in the speed of innovation
 and you expect it to be several times faster than it was over the last 15 years, then imagine
 what we, if we think about what we did in the last 15 years, well, what do you think
 is going to happen in the next 10?
 It's going to be, this is going to be a very, very, very exciting eight to 10 years.
 Yeah, no, that's crazy.
 That's crazy.
 I mean, yeah, it's weird.
 It's like with me personally, like there's a side of me, you know, there's like the,
 cause I'm also a computer science graduate, right?
 So, you know, there's a part of me and I love technology.
 I'm really into, you know, innovation and stuff.
 So there's a part of me that's like, yeah, awesome.
 Like I'm super excited.
 I think, do you know where I think a lot of my pause comes from is that in the past 15
 years, I've also seen a lot of the like legitimately detrimental effects, even of just social media,
 right?
 So in terms of people are lonely, suicide rates going up, depression rising, anxiety
 rising, you know, people's own physical health, right?
 If you're just sitting in front of a computer all day, instead of doing any work or manual
 labor, et cetera, that's not very good for you unless you're counteracting it.
 And so I think because I've seen that and I've seen that shift happen, especially amongst
 younger people, as cool as I think the technology is, I'm also kind of like, man, what's going
 to happen to people, people's humanity, right?
 It's cool having like all of this tech and being able to do all this cool stuff, but
 what's people's, what's going to be the deal with people's physical health, with people's
 mental health, et cetera, right?
 We're already seeing people kind of going nuts as it is.
 So I think that's the concern for me.
 That's really interesting.
 And I think everything's going to accelerate and everything is going to be turned up to
 11.
 I actually had that fear.
 And then again, I learned to sort of just embrace it and accept.
 I think what's going to happen is you're going to see different parties form, but on a micro
 level.
 I think there's a factionalism at the nth degree.
 I don't necessarily think that having everybody connected leads to this situation where everybody
 is listening to everybody else.
 What we see, and again, we just observed what happens on platforms like Twitter, is that
 people form these ever more impenetrable bubbles where if someone has an opposing view, they
 block them.
 But every time you block, you reduce communication and you're only listening to the echo chamber.
 So if you just extrapolate, that's just going to get stronger and stronger and stronger
 and stronger, where literally all you know are the people within your echo chamber and
 you almost never move beyond.
 At some point, you're going to start realizing it's going to keep progressing until it becomes
 ridiculous.
 And then you will realize that, and my hope is that we will get to a point where people
 will realize that all of these mechanisms that we have to discriminate, to form views
 and so on, are actually all BS.
 And then we will move to this post, still just past Neanderthal society, to this ideal
 utopian society where people actually have a different view.
 So actually, when you see certain people get into power in very powerful countries with
 very regressive views, I actually think that's good.
 And the reason why it's good is it will accelerate to the point of ridiculousness.
 You're already seeing some of the things now happening, even a decade ago in politics,
 in many major countries, literally a year ago, people would have resigned if they ever
 did or they would have never allowed to be in power.
 Now they're allowed to be in power if we don't kill ourselves.
 But I feel also, I think the chance of, I did have that worry that we would end up in
 some sort of war from this.
 But now I also believe that that's very, that's something gave me a very strong and I think
 valid argument for why that won't happen, which is wars happen where privileged people
 get or wealthy people get the underprivileged to fight and die and why they don't get involved.
 But now with the invention of thermonuclear bombs, it's not possible for two major powers
 to get in a war without the actual privileged people themselves being affected.
 And so now they can be affected.
 You're never going to see a war again.
 At least not on a scale, it'll be microwaves because now everybody is impacted by it, not
 just some subset that you can say you can farm off and go off to fight.
 And so you will still have some skirmishes in the physical world.
 You will not have these sort of thermonuclear wars.
 And again, if you go online and virtual, the need to have physical wars goes down as well.
 So it just, you'll see, you're going to instead, it's going to be, but people do still need
 to have to compete.
 Maslow's hierarchy of needs suggests that people have a desire for esteem, which an
 esteem requires you to feel more important than someone else.
 So there will still be wars, but they will all be these cold or argument wars, you know,
 which is what you'll see on Twitter.
 So verbal wars will happen all the time.
 But I prefer a world where people are having lots of verbal wars and not actually shooting
 people for, you know, you know, for just going shopping and being the wrong skin tone or,
 or whatever it is they do.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No, it's a, it's a super interesting take.
 Like, um, no, I love the conversations like this cause it's like, it can go with my, my
 brain is just sort of going in all these different, all these different directions and considerations.
 And, um, uh, one thing we haven't talked about though, of course, is, um, your, your bread
 and butter, which is Bitcoin.
 So how did you even discover Bitcoin to begin with?
 So, um, I mean, so there's a background, I was a geek.
 So I was, I was a CTO or a head of technology for various tech companies for many years.
 And I studied computer science and I was being interested since I was a teenager.
 So anytime a new technology comes out, um, especially if it seemed to have a relation
 to some of the themes that I found of interest, i.e. increasing people's access to, increasing
 people's access to technology, making the world more meritocratic, et cetera, et cetera.
 I was, I would be interested.
 Um, so along came Bitcoin and, and I can't remember who, but someone forwarded me an
 article about it, um, in 2011.
 And so that's when I first heard about it, I started investigating it, but initially
 it was purely as a, from a technology, technology point of view.
 And I found it technologically very interesting, but, um, I didn't think it would re it would
 have much of a chance.
 It didn't have any significant value at that time.
 It was, I think it was like 20 pounds or so.
 And then I remember the price plummeting down to far lower than that, it lost about 70,
 80% of its value.
 And I thought, well, this is going to be, this is useless in that respect and forgot
 about it and carried on with my own startup, which, you know, if you know, startups, they
 take a well of a bandwidth.
 Um, and then two years later, my, my soon to be co-founder who had previously angel
 invested came to me with this idea of, um, coin floor, um, and setting up a Bitcoin exchange
 of UK and I looked at the price and it was now in the hundreds of pounds.
 And I thought, okay, this is when the penny started to drop.
 It still took a couple of years of really understanding it.
 But what I realized was that this wasn't just a technology, but there was something more
 behind it.
 That's something that's underpinned it.
 And that's when I really got involved.
 Um, and I could sort, and that's when I really got excited.
 Now when it was in 2011, I thought it had zero chance of succeeding in 2013 I'd thought
 probably he's got a 20% chance, but, um, as someone who's, um, had, um, a couple of startups
 by that point, um, 20% chance is a great chance.
 Is it, is it, is it definitely enough, especially cause it's fun, it's exciting.
 And if it does work, it has the chance to change the world.
 So we got involved and the rest was history.
 That's interesting.
 So what was it specifically that made you change your mind?
 Was it just seeing the, the change in the value itself in terms of the price point and
 the fact that people were buying it and investing in it, or was it something more to do with
 the technology?
 So the technology I've always found fascinating and as I'm now, and I have been for seven
 years, um, 100% focused on it, I've been able to delve more and more and more into it.
 And so I'm able to look at it and I've come from a technical background in the first place.
 So that's allowed me, so that's always been part of it.
 It's allowed me to realize that there's something incredibly elegant about what Bitcoin does.
 And also allowed me to realize that basically pretty much every other cryptocurrency misses
 the point and by a wide margin.
 But the other thing, it started with the price because the value suggests that people are
 storing value in this currency, which means that they are seeing something, something
 kind of interesting about it.
 And that's what got me back in 2013.
 But what's kept me here, it was this realization, as I mentioned before, that I got over the
 following couple of years that the most powerful thing about
 Bitcoin, which almost every other cryptocurrency fails to get, is that the philosophy of the
 people who support it and hold it and advance it is completely different to the philosophy
 of the existing system.
 And that is its power.
 It is an alternative.
 It's a different mindset.
 And the technology over time will reflect the mindset of the population of people who
 use it.
 So, in the case of other cryptocurrencies, even though they might...
 Sorry to jump in.
 Can you explain that a little bit more?
 Because there will be some listeners who are not familiar with Bitcoin at all.
 So when you talk about that philosophy before comparing it to other cryptos, can you explain
 that philosophy?
 Okay.
 No problem.
 Yeah.
 So, my pleasure.
 There are a number of elements, but fundamentally, Bitcoin, at the heart of a number of different
 philosophies, one of them is that you should not trust other people with...
 Blindly trust other people with your money.
 And if people are telling you that, look, basically behave like a child, don't worry
 about your money, we will handle everything for you, you should worry.
 Now, of course, you should expect that they will take steps to...
 If you do have to have them look after your money, that they will take steps to look after
 it for you and provide you evidence that they were doing it.
 But ultimately, you gain power by holding the capital yourself.
 Now, for nearly 50 years, because fiat money, as we understand fiat money today, has only
 been around for 50 years, people don't realize it's only existed for 50 years, as the predominant
 form of money.
 The way you would hold on to money is you'd hold on to money yourself.
 You could hold it in the form of gold, et cetera, silver, and hold on to your money.
 But that wasn't practical in a modern digital age.
 Bitcoin brings back the ability to hold money yourself.
 And that's one of the core philosophies.
 So in a sentence, it's don't trust verify, and also self custody, self sovereignty of
 your capital.
 These are two very, very different philosophies from the existing system.
 Now, many other platforms suggest that you shouldn't worry about that.
 It should be decentralized, but just you don't need to worry about the decentralization.
 Lots of big companies or experienced tech guys and girls will handle the details for
 you.
 But it's better than the banking system because it isn't banks.
 But if you believe in that philosophy, eventually that system will morph into a neo-banking
 system.
 Those tech guys and girls will become the new banks, and it will end up looking like
 the existing system.
 So unless you start with a philosophy that's different, you will always end up with something
 that's the same.
 Gotcha.
 So in your own mind, do you see any role whatsoever long-term for other cryptocurrencies or purely
 Bitcoin?
 So I think that there could be some role, potentially.
 Everything's a probability-based thing, so I don't think it can be put as zero.
 But if you look at the history of money, any time a new money comes into play that's better
 than what existed before, eventually the vast majority of trade volume and value held will
 be held in that new money.
 So it could be that there's 1% of volume could be coming through all other cryptocurrencies
 combined, so that's non-zero.
 And 1% of a multi-trillion dollar market is still a significant amount of money.
 But the vast majority of value, and I think it's 99 plus percent, will be in Bitcoin in
 the fullness of time.
 And when you say the fullness of time, what sort of timescale are you willing to put any
 sort of timescale on that?
 So that's a harder one to do.
 One, I think the people in the Bitcoin space, again, another difference in philosophy is
 they, well, this is actually an area where I do have concerns, actually, with Bitcoin.
 But at least a lot of the people who really understand Bitcoin have a low time preference.
 And what we mean by that is that they will keep working on it.
 They know this is a very powerful technology, and the job it's trying to achieve or the
 task it's trying to achieve, which is become the new world reserve currency, is a very
 big task.
 So whether it takes five years or 15 or 20 years, they're still incredibly fast to become
 the new world reserve currency.
 And so, but what I can say is with most changes or shifts, what tends to happen is that the
 potential energy, the desire for the change and the pressure builds and builds and builds.
 But the actual change happens incredibly fast and often violently.
 Hopefully, in this case, it won't be violently, but it tends to happen very quickly.
 So when it does actually shift, it will be a case of musical chairs.
 So if you either you've sort of, you're on the crypto Noah's Ark or the Bitcoin Noah's
 Ark or you're not, because when the flood comes in, you can't then, you won't have time
 to switch at that point.
 Yeah.
 So here's a big question based on what you've just said.
 I mean, because yourself and a lot of Bitcoin proponents and advocates, one thing people
 talk a lot about is increasing equality and, you know, banking the unbanked, helping out
 developing countries, et cetera, and reducing some of the wealth inequalities that are in
 the world.
 But that seems a little bit counterintuitive to me because if Bitcoin is to go on and,
 you know, become massively valuable and massively successful, wouldn't that just totally create
 income, not income, but wealth inequality on a scale that we've never even seen before?
 Because the people who bought in, you know, 2011, 2012, 2013, et cetera, versus the people
 who sort of come late to the party, wouldn't that just make those people, I don't know,
 maybe we'll even end up with some trillionaires in that class and then everyone else will
 be fighting over the scraps.
 So, or am I missing something there?
 So I don't think it will lead to, well, first of all, I think that's the, at least from
 my view, is that that's the wrong type of inequality to focus on.
 It's not about wealth inequality.
 It's about opportunity inequality that you're trying to deal with.
 It's back to the same things around remote working being the norm, working in virtual
 reality, so the way you look and background being the norm, these could lead to, you could
 have scenarios where in VR or in a remote work environment, you can have hyper-centralization
 where there's certain organizations become incredibly wealthy because of that.
 However, the opportunities become equalized.
 It becomes more meritocratic.
 And that's what I'm personally more concerned about.
 Everybody has the same chance.
 So that's one side of it.
 It's about opportunity inequality.
 Can you go into that a little bit more?
 How would everybody have the same chance in this world?
 Okay.
 So if you are not, back to some of our early discussions, if you are able to transact with
 anybody on anywhere in the world and there isn't a way to, and there isn't a inequality
 of access to the ability to transact, and the service that you're providing is something
 that's a purely digital service because most services of value will be purely digital,
 and we're seeing that already.
 The majority of millionaires in the world are either in the financial services space
 or the technology space, which are purely informational-based businesses.
 So it's already the reality.
 Then you are able to transact with anybody anywhere in the world and not have to, and
 there's no mechanisms to discriminate between one party or the other, other than the quality
 of the offering that you provide.
 And that is what I mean by equality of opportunity.
 Okay.
 I get you.
 I get you.
 I feel like there was-
 Yeah.
 And the other side is this, that if you look back at people's ability to hold onto wealth
 through generations, it's actually really bad.
 Actually, people aren't necessarily able to maintain wealth.
 Most people weren't able to maintain wealth from generation to generation to generation
 pre-modern monetary theory.
 And modern monetary theory is all about fiat money and we should borrow and so on and so
 forth and fraction reserve and all this sort of stuff.
 Pre that, when we lived in a world where we were predominantly had commodity money, it
 was very unlikely that as you pass down your wealth to little Johnny or little Jane or
 whatever that they would manage to keep hold of it.
 Because if they weren't as good at managing their resources as you, they would make mistakes
 and so on and tend to lose money.
 The same thing happens today, but the difference is that the world we live in today where we
 have inflation, so money goes down in value over time and it doesn't actually go down
 in value, it just affects, well, it does go down in value, but what that effectively causes
 to happen is that money is redistributed from everybody to the central bank and then that
 distributes it down, but it ends up staying in the hands of the wealthiest.
 That effectively acts as a compensation for incompetence.
 So even though natural incompetence will lead to a redistribution of wealth, it's constantly
 being refilled up at the top through inflation.
 If you remove inflation, then it will go back to the central bank.
 the way we were in a commodity-based world where if your children or the people you choose
 to pass your wealth on to happen to also be as effective a business as you, they will
 maintain the wealth. And if they don't, they will naturally lose it, get hacked, or whatever
 it may be, and it will slowly redistribute naturally and be available for other people
 who are willing to work harder and have equal opportunity to take. So you have two forces
 which will work together to help equalize capital, equalize opportunity and equalize
 capital.
 Gotcha. And here's another question. How do you see Bitcoin fitting in with all of
 the other currencies that exist in the world? So do you see Bitcoin being the digital gold
 or the universal reserve currency and people are still using pounds and dollars and euros
 on a sort of day-to-day level and on a local level? Or do you see the potential for Bitcoin
 to almost supersede and sort of just eat everything?
 I think it's both and it's just phases. So phase one is Bitcoin is already behaving like
 a digital gold and this store of value. And as such, if as people, especially in this
 world where we're likely to experience higher rates of inflation, people will more and more
 start to understand the value of holding money in stores of value. And they're trying to
 do it right now with investing in the stock market, but they're over-inflating stocks
 to beyond their actual value. They previously were doing it in property, but people are
 priced out of properties, et cetera. And we may be seeing a price shock on property as
 well. Bitcoin is fast becoming a new mechanism to store value in the minds of, it's already
 in my mind and in your mind, but in the minds of everyday people. And the advantage it has
 over all those others is you can, it's far more liquid. You can buy and sell it whenever
 you want and you can buy very small amounts. If it wants to, you can buy 10 P's worth of
 it, which is hard to buy 10 P's worth of gold, for example. So it's accessible to anybody
 with a mobile phone and an internet connection. And so that's it. So because of that, and
 because that use case is valuable and it can already do that really well right now, that's
 where we're going to see it start. But if you have something that becomes ever more,
 people build more and more confidence as a store of value, they will then start to, people
 will covet it more and more. And so the next stage, you're going to start to see merchants
 wanting to accept this ever increasing store of value in preference over a currency that
 goes down in value. It's just a natural incentive to do. That won't happen until a number of
 technological advances are made to Bitcoin in terms of scaling. But there's huge amounts
 of work happening in that regard. I'm not sure the sophistication of your listeners,
 but there are technologies such as the Lightning Network and Taproot and Schnorr signatures
 and many other things in the background designed to deal with the second phase, i.e. turning
 it into a mechanism to compete with Apple Pay and Google Pay and PayPal and so on, and
 many other things with pay in the name to be able to transact.
 Yeah. So you're essentially saying that to kind of put this in layman's terms, that a
 lot of the concerns people currently have regarding Bitcoin in terms of speed and cost
 of transactions, et cetera, there's a lot of headway that's currently being made on
 that.
 Yeah. It's just a matter of time preference. If your view is unless it's fast now, it's
 useless, then it's useless. But if your view is right now, it's a very good store of value
 and that's a very valuable thing to do, especially in a world where values of things that we
 normally are used to storing are dropping everywhere. Let me use it for that now and
 let me wait a few years for that other use case. I mean, right now I should be spending
 my bit anyway, because that's going down in value. If I've got Bitcoin and fiat and I've
 got two, you've got two different things. One is going up in value over time. The other
 was going down in value over time. Which one are you going to spend first?
 The one that's going down in value.
 Exactly.
 Yeah. So here's a question. And this is because I've been tweeting about Bitcoin and writing
 about I've been tweeting about Bitcoin for three years. And of course, with an audience
 like mine, one of the most common things you get, of course, is Bitcoin is a scam. So for
 someone who maybe is even listening to this or when I post this interview online, you
 know, and I get these as expected, Bitcoin is a scam comments. What is your what's your
 sort of best and cleanest response to people who just think that this thing is just it's
 just a scam and it's this elaborate plan that we're just going to we're just going to.
 I've been thinking about this. And my answer would be, but and it depends. Do they think
 all cryptos are scam or they're just bitcoins a scam?
 These people tend to think that all cryptos are a scam.
 Okay.
 That's the kind of person.
 So it's really simple. I'll say you're completely right just to keep all your money in fiat.
 Because what I've realized is that, as I say, Bitcoin is a philosophy first technology second.
 And it's going to tend over time to ape the philosophy of the earliest people in the group.
 And so what I realized is my job is not to get everybody into Bitcoin. And if we fill
 Bitcoin with people who are who are not willing to understand and internalize the philosophy,
 then it will die before it begins.
 Gotcha.
 That's the biggest risk. So if someone is starting with that viewpoint and they're really
 intransigent and not willing to learn, you do not want them into Bitcoin right now. They
 should stay in fiat and they need to be the last people to come into this space. But if
 someone comes in with an open mind and they want to learn and are willing to reassess
 their views about money, then open doors. So that actually is great because it's like,
 for example, I like the fact that free speech online, as someone told me, because people
 are becoming more and more comfortable about saying whatever they want to say, etc. And
 it's really good. I much prefer to know someone's an asshole as opposed to there being an asshole
 behind my back.
 I'm with you.
 I much prefer. So it's great that there's free speech because then I can identify the
 assholes and I can act accordingly. And if someone is saying it's a scam, it's a scam
 and they're not willing to listen to anything, then I'm like, great. I know the people who
 we do not want into Bitcoin right now when it's still really young and there's still
 a lot of opportunity. Why spend effort giving them access to this such this fundamental
 technology and this fundamental opportunity? It's a once in a lifedime opportunity. Why?
 When there's other people who are willing to learn, because I know every day there are
 ever increasing amounts. I see it. Ever increasing amounts of people coming in. We're seeing
 captains of industry and we're seeing people who are baby boomers, who are used to a culture
 of saving and they can see that Bitcoin actually fits what they're used to.
 My parents have Bitcoin.
 Yeah. I mean, I just tweeted this morning because I just had a realization. It's like
 someone saying to me, so I just tweeted, it's like, as kids, we're taught to save up money
 and spend carefully. Modern monetary theory and fiat, we're taught that we should acquire
 debt and spend carelessly. And then Bitcoin teaches us, and as Bitcoin holders, you're
 taught to save Bitcoin and buy carefully. Guess which one is right? And if you can't
 figure that one out, then really you right now is not the time because you will eventually
 come. You'll either come in willingly and learn or you're going to be dragged in. So
 they will come. Bitcoin is this gravitational force, which is dragging everybody in, but
 it will drag the things that are closer to it philosophically faster than the things
 that are further away. And it's as simple as that. And you're far away, unfortunately.
 Enjoy your fiat.
