 (upbeat music)
 - Everybody, welcome to the "What Is Money?" show.
 I am thrilled to have you here joining me on my mission
 to help shine light on the corruption of money.
 Now, a little bit about this show and how it makes money.
 We are 100% sponsor-based,
 which means that all the revenues we derive
 come from sponsorships.
 But I try to be very selective about the sponsors
 that I work with,
 specifically trying to choose those who have values
 well-aligned to the values expressed on this show,
 like freedom, education, self-sovereignty, et cetera.
 So what I'm gonna do is a few ad reads
 right here at the top of the show,
 and then a few ad reads in the middle.
 And I hope you won't skip them.
 I hope you'll take the time,
 listen and see what they have to offer,
 'cause again, these are hand-selected sponsors.
 Now I'd like to tell you about our sponsor, Swan Private.
 Swan Private is a concierge financial services firm
 based in Los Angeles.
 Now, I've known the Swan team for years,
 and these guys are laser-focused on the Bitcoin mission.
 They even have a zero-tolerance policy for all shitcoin.
 Recently, their CEO, Corey Clipston, was instrumental
 in calling out many of these crypto scams
 right before they collapsed,
 saving a lot of people a lot of money in the process.
 Swan Private focuses on guiding high-net-worth individuals
 and businesses on all aspects of Bitcoin strategy,
 including buying, custodying, and market research.
 This concierge service provides you direct access
 to a private advisor by text, phone, or email.
 So go to swanprivate.com/breedlove today to sign up.
 Now I'd like to tell you about our sponsor, Ledin.
 Ledin lets you do more with your digital assets.
 For instance, Ledin offers a B2X loan product
 that lets you leverage your existing Bitcoin
 to buy even more Bitcoin.
 Or you can also get traditional Bitcoin collateralized
 US dollar loans through Ledin as well.
 Ledin also offers both Bitcoin
 and USDC-denominated savings accounts,
 letting you generate yield on your digital assets.
 Recently, Ledin has launched
 a Bitcoin mortgage product as well
 that lets you use Bitcoin to buy a home
 or finance one that you already own.
 So go to ledin.io, that's L-E-D-N.I-O, today to sign up.
 - Obinuosu, welcome back to the "What Is Money?" show.
 - Robert Breedlove, lovely to be back.
 - Glad to have you here.
 As we were just saying offline,
 I think we left off last time
 just getting into the conversation about Fedimint.
 And as I have here in my notes,
 Fedimint is a privacy-preserving custody system,
 which is a federated system of guardians.
 And I have MultiSig plus ShowMeInE-Cash
 plus Lightning Network.
 Can you help us understand exactly what Fedimint is
 and what it is comprised of?
 - Okay, well, I'll answer that in different layers.
 So first of all, at the sort of most philosophical layer,
 Fedimint is the missing piece
 of the Bitcoin open-source ecosystem.
 It's the thing that completes it.
 It's Jerry Maguire's Ren√© Zellweger, effectively.
 So you have at the base, you've got Bitcoin,
 the Bitcoin protocol, which is your hard money.
 It's your store of value, your meritocratic money.
 And on top of that, we have the Lightning Network,
 Lightning protocol, which takes that Bitcoin
 and allows you to send it around
 from person to person at lightning speed
 at low cost with enhanced privacy.
 But the missing piece and what Fedimint provides you
 is a way of custodying that Bitcoin
 with enhanced security, incredible privacy,
 and also extensibility,
 something that we haven't talked about much,
 but is actually a core part of Fedimint as well.
 So it can be extended with extra federated finance features.
 Think of it as Fedi Fi as well.
 So when you add those together,
 and it works very well with Lightning,
 and in fact, it improves with Lightning,
 and Lightning works very well with Fedimint.
 In fact, Fedimint can help scale Lightning.
 So they work very, very well with each other.
 So when you add it all together,
 you have a way of holding your money at rest with privacy,
 spending it with enhanced privacy through Lightning,
 extending features and functionality through Fedimint,
 sending the money around at low costs
 through Lightning as well,
 and all backed by and working closely
 with Bitcoin at the base.
 So that's it in terms of where it fits
 within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
 And if we look into Fedimint itself, how does it do this?
 Fedimint is a form of federated application server.
 So it can take any application
 that would normally only run by a single person
 or a single process, but then split it up
 so that it can be run by a number of people.
 It's federation, such that as long as the majority of them
 are honest and running, it will keep on operating correctly.
 And in fact, even if a minority,
 a significant minority of them are honest,
 it will prevent a small majority of them
 subverting the process and forcing it
 to do something you don't want.
 So it gives you a much greater level
 of bad actor protection, but it's able to run any process,
 pretty much any process in theory
 that could run normally on one machine,
 but you can federate it to reduce your reliance
 on a bad actor.
 So it gives you enhanced censorship resistance,
 not as much as a fully decentralized network like Bitcoin,
 but far more than a centralized service
 such as running it on an exchange.
 So that's what a federation applies.
 Now, why would you, there is an overhead to do that.
 It's, you can imagine just like the Bitcoin network
 at the extreme is, it has a massive overheads
 to provide that level of decentralization.
 Federations are somewhere in the middle.
 There is significant overheads compared
 to just running on one machine, running in the federation.
 So why would you wanna do that?
 There are very few processes you wanna purposely increase
 the overhead of running it
 for increased bad actor protection.
 And they come down to financial services.
 So holding your money, multisig, Bitcoin multisig
 is one of the first functionality that we,
 that comes as standard with a FedEmit federation.
 Maintaining cryptographically near perfect privacy.
 We use the protocol called Charmin Ecash,
 which was invented by David Charmin in 1983.
 In fact, next year will be its 40th anniversary.
 It's considered catnip to cryptographers.
 It provides near cryptographically perfect privacy,
 but until the use of Bitcoin and federations,
 it had one weakness, which it relied on one bank,
 a single actor, but the federation again,
 allows you to federate that single actor.
 So now we rely on a community of trusted guardians.
 And also federations and FedEmits are not dealing normally
 with payments between people anywhere in the world.
 So it provides a module for a federated access
 to the Lightning Network.
 And so it works very well with Lightning nodes
 and the rest of the Lightning Network.
 So those three things come as standard with FedEmit.
 Custodying your Bitcoin,
 maintaining cryptographically perfect privacy,
 and interacting with the Lightning Network.
 You can extend it with other features,
 and many people are looking to work on that in the future,
 but by default, that gives you the minimum you need
 to custody in a community context.
 And then the last bit that's really important is,
 just like Bitcoin is a combination of technology
 and also game theory, a human aspect,
 the same is true with Bitcoin and with FedEmit.
 The technology we've explained,
 but just as important is the context
 is we recommend that's used it.
 So it's recommended that you use this
 for community custody.
 This is what we call communal second party custody.
 So community comes together.
 They have a requirement to, like everybody in the world,
 the community and the members of the community
 have a requirement to hold money, to transfer money,
 to interact, to perform commerce.
 This is an essential step to improving and enriching
 and bettering the lives of the people in that community.
 So they come together.
 Instead of relying on a third party,
 a stranger who is incentivized by money,
 and we all know with recent events that can end badly,
 giving money to someone who's incentivized by money,
 the community comes together,
 determines the most trustworthy, the most high integrity,
 the most community service oriented members of the community
 to act as guardians on behalf of the community
 with some small level of technical skill,
 but not very much.
 They have the same level of skill needed to run
 to operate a set-top box for a cable television program.
 So non-zero level of technical skill.
 So these guardians are then chosen
 to run the FedeMint software.
 They form a federation,
 which will then run in a federated manner,
 the multi-sig for the community,
 the Charmin eCash protocol
 to provide provided to the community,
 and the Lightning interface protocol
 to provide connectivity to the Lightning network
 on behalf of the community.
 So effectively, the community comes together
 to custody Bitcoin on behalf of the community
 to empower the community
 without relying on anyone outside of that community.
 It's like be your community's bank
 as opposed to be your own bank.
 - So that, I mean, would that be then
 like the historical corollary to this
 is like a communal banking model,
 but then somehow facilitated by better software, right?
 You get more privacy, single bank custody, et cetera.
 - That's very much the case.
 And this is not even historical.
 In the West, it's more historical,
 though we still have community banking,
 but in the global South,
 it is still an everyday, very, very common occurrence.
 And actually in post-Soviet regions,
 people living under the yoke of authoritarian regimes
 and dictatorships.
 So if you take either of those two groups,
 the global South is more than half the world.
 People living, if you split the world in a separate way,
 people who are not living in democracies,
 people who are living under the yoke
 of authoritarian regimes and dictatorships,
 again, that's more than half the world.
 And combined, they're two thirds of the world.
 People living in more affluent parts of the world,
 which are democracies, are the minority.
 We are the edge case.
 So for the normal case of the world,
 you either have no banking,
 that we would consider reasonable levels of banking,
 or you have banking, but you cannot trust your banking.
 So for example, if you're in a authoritarian regime,
 we have stories of people receiving money
 from their normal bank accounts, KYC.
 goes along with that. The recipient is in a country under the yoke of an authoritarian
 regime or dictator and they get arrested because the source is not, it is the source of a person
 who's identified as having sympathies with the opposition to the dictator. So they get
 arrested, they get imprisoned, sometimes killed. So they have banking, but they cannot trust
 it, although they may be relatively affluent as a country. And then other parts of the
 world where they just don't have banking. In these scenarios, they have to rely upon
 their community. And so communal forms of banking are alive and strong. There are names
 such as in Kenya, I've seen these things called SAKOs, and that's where communities, villages
 come together. They cannot get loans from normal banks, so they have to store, they
 give one person the task of taking, collecting a small amount of money from different people
 in a village or a town or even a small city. And then that's collected and then they do
 different things with it, depending on the country, depending on the situation. Sometimes
 they store it and give it to one person at the end of each month and a different person
 at the end of each month. Sometimes they just create a pool and then they lend out effectively
 to other people within the community. And for an interest that goes back into the pool.
 Sometimes it acts as an insurance fund, sometimes it acts as a fund to underwrite people's loans.
 So then the person goes back to a bank where they normally can't get a loan, but then they
 can show that this community fund has got a certain amount of capital in it. And the
 community as a whole underwrites the loan on behalf of the individual. And because it's
 underwritten by this pool of money, the individual is able to get a much more affordable set
 of terms for their loan from an external party. And there's everything in between. You also
 have systems like Hoala, which are systems for money transmission, but rely on communities
 as well. So if you look in the Middle East, in Southeast Asia, in Latin America, in Africa,
 these are prevalent in pretty much every country. And it's the norm. But the problem is because
 they're manual processes, they rely on a single person that you trust. And also you don't
 have privacy because the people know who's being paid and what, etc. And privacy is important,
 especially when we reach global scale. Right now, we have three or four as of the implosion
 of one of the largest exchanges, three or four exchanges with well over 90%, 90, 95%
 of all volume trade on them and a large percentage of all users custodian of them. And if this
 we allow this to scale, we're going to get to a world of 8 billion people with accounts
 where 90 to 95% will have accounts on half a dozen exchanges. We worry about CBDCs with
 countries with populations of 100 million. Or there will be these private enterprises
 which are effectively oligarchies, structurally, companies are oligarchies run by one person
 with absolute control, or at best, a few people like a board will have full visibility on
 people's holding people's balances, full visibility on their payments, full visibility on their
 trades, if they add cards and so on and so forth, they have full visibility. That's an
 Orwellian nightmare. And so at scale, we need privacy. But even today, in a community context,
 in a local community context, privacy is even more important. Even within the smaller and
 more close to the community, the more important it is for you to have financial privacy, you
 might have, for example, lost your job or have have some sensitive news, something that
 you don't want to share with relatives or family, you know, you might you might have
 things that you you're trying to work out, you want to buy things or to test to make
 some tests or whatever it may be. And having privacy from your next door neighbors and
 your family and your brothers and sisters is, it's really, really important. So in a
 community context, you have to, by default, have perfect privacy if you can. So it's essential
 to have it from the get go.
 Interesting. So I like a lot of things here. So Fedi, I think this is how you said it
 is the completion of the Bitcoin open source tech stack.
 Yes, it's
 Sorry, go ahead.
 No, no, that's correct.
 That's correct. Okay. So that's really interesting. And then I like the perspective you gave on
 increasing the cost of overhead to disincentivize dishonesty. Because that's I mean, that's
 kind of what that's another framing for Bitcoin. It's all this redundancy, but it's really
 just there to disincentivize dishonesty such that we get everyone adhering to the 21 million
 hard cap, for instance. So that's an interesting perspective on the game theory of Bitcoin.
 Now you mentioned obtaining near perfect privacy, I guess you might say in this new model. And
 in my notes here, I have the Las Vegas example. I don't know if those two things are related.
 They're related. So many of your business may be aware that transaction on the Bitcoin
 main chain are not perfectly private. There is the very fact that you want to maintain
 all the stability to know that the one of its most important features of the 21 million
 cap has not been busted has not been broken, requires you to maintain certain information
 on balances being held in different UTXOs and being able to add those up to make sure
 they are what they're supposed to be when transactions happen to send value from one
 person to another. You want to be able to ensure that no money has been printed by some
 nefarious bad actor. But this requires a level of traceability. People are looking at ways
 of reducing this. There is zero knowledge proofs, confidential transactions, but there's
 still a level of traceability because you still see where the movements of money, you
 just don't see the amounts, for example. And perfect privacy and perfect auditability are
 sort of in conflict with each other. So that base layer out of the two, the way it's structured,
 the code has prioritized auditability over perfect privacy. But at higher layers, when
 you have a trusted community where you know that you can make the assumption that we can
 optimize our system for perfect privacy, but by definition, if you have perfect privacy,
 then you lose auditability because if it's perfect privacy, you don't know the balances
 of people. You also don't know who has paid as the operator of this or someone viewing
 the network, as it were. You don't know who has paid what, so you don't know what transactions
 that occurred. And also you don't know how many users you have. These are all pieces
 of information that are perfect privacy, then it shouldn't be possible to know that I'm
 a member of the Federation or not. Therefore, the Federation shouldn't know whether they
 have three users or three billion users. They cannot know. And then they shouldn't know
 who has paid who, because I want to have privacy of my transactions. And they shouldn't know
 what balances are held by who. They know overall that this, just by looking at the amount of
 Bitcoin held of them, the total amount of Bitcoin, but they cannot know how it's distributed
 amongst which users and when those distributions happened. If you have all those three elements,
 and you have near perfect privacy, there's always ways in which users can box themselves
 or reduce their privacy. They can go in front of all the guardians and say, "Hey guys, I'm
 doing a transaction now, and look at me doing a transaction." That's actually not the network
 itself boxing you, but it is possible for you to intentionally box yourself. But if
 you're in the street and you make a payment from within the FedEments app to someone else,
 within the FedEments ecosystem, just to give you a background, when you deposit Bitcoin
 into the system, it goes into this federated multi-sig wallet run by the Federation. But
 then they issue, as a Federation, in a federated manner, i.e. not trusting any single guardian,
 but as a whole, they issue an equal number of e-cash tokens, Charmin e-cash tokens. And
 these are tokens which are indistinguishable. They're issued in a way which means they're
 indistinguishable from one another. You could have issued a token a second ago, and then
 someone asked to redeem a token a second later, and you have no idea if it was one you issued
 a year ago or the one you just issued. There's no way to determine the difference. Because
 when you sign it to say it's valid, it's a blinded signature. You don't know what you're
 signing. So when it comes back to you after it's been unblinded, you don't know if it
 was the one you signed a second ago or a year ago. So there's no way for you to know that.
 So these e-cash tokens are bearer instruments in the naive, sort of common sense understanding
 of the word. You have a token per coin. So for example, let's say you had 10.51 units.
 So if it was in dollars, $10.51. Or for example, just for simplicity, 10.51 units of these
 tokens, and that could be 10.51 Bitcoin, for example. If I wanted to pay someone $1 and
 $1.11, I don't send them a transaction for $1.11. I will send them, I'll have a number
 of e-cash tokens of different denominations. So I would have 10 $1 e-cash tokens, 5 $1
 e-cash tokens, and 5 $0.10 e-cash tokens, and 1 $0.01 e-cash token. So if I want to
 send you $1.11, I would literally send you a $1 token. I would send you a $0.10 token,
 an e-cash token, and I'll send you a $0.01 e-cash token. The same way you would do with
 cash if you had $10.51 in your purse or wallet. It was 10 $1 notes, 5 $0.10 notes, and 1 $0.01
 note. And if you wanted to give someone $1.11, you would give them a $1 note, a $0.10 note,
 and a $0.01 note. It's exactly the same, but instead of it being coins you're sending,
 you're sending different files, each one representing a physical piece of cash. And as such, it's
 this bearer instrument that can be sent around from one person to another directly without
 going through the guardians. Once they're created, you can pass them around like e-cash.
 In fact, this allows us in a community context to do
 some very interesting things.
 So one of the things that we are going to be adding
 or showing in the future is the ability
 for limited periods of time to make transactions
 without an internet connection.
 Because you can send it directly through these E-cash tokens
 within a community, even if you lose internet,
 you can still send the tokens, for example,
 through QR codes from one person to another
 because they are bearer instruments.
 So that's very useful.
 If the internet's gone down or if you're underground
 and you need to send money from one person to another,
 as long as you're part of the same community,
 if you want to make a lightning payment
 to someone near the other side of the world,
 you won't be able to because you have no internet.
 But guess what?
 You have no internet, so you won't be able to anyway.
 But if you're locally, if you're local in El Zonte
 and the internet's just gone down
 but you want to buy something by the side of the road,
 you could still send, show an animated QR code
 with the displaying all the different E-cash tokens
 and the other person can scan and receive that.
 Now, there is a risk when the internet goes back up
 of double spend risk, but the likelihood
 that the merchant or the seller on the side of the road
 who's all part of the same community,
 so you'll know, you'll still know
 when you received the tokens as the receiver
 and who you received it from,
 the likelihood that the sender in that context
 is going to take the code, decompile it,
 patch the code, recompile the APK,
 and then make the payment so that they can double spend
 a few cents or a few dollars.
 And in the full knowledge that they have proof
 of punishability because they are part of the community,
 the community can ostracize them or they can do,
 they can walk up to them and punch them in the nose,
 proof of being able to be walked up to being punched
 on the nose ability, which is possible within a community,
 which is not possible if you're buying something
 from the other side of the world from a stranger.
 It is very possible compared to the cost.
 It means that actually for limited periods of time,
 no internet doesn't stop you transacting.
 And these are all possible because of this bearer instrument
 and many, many other really exciting features
 that are possible when you recognize
 that you're working in a community context
 and that gives you superpowers
 that you don't have in other contexts.
 - That's super interesting.
 Basically they have skin in the game still
 as part of these communities.
 So that prevents them
 or hopefully disincentivizes bad behavior.
 That's a good point there.
 So-
 - It disincentivizes, it disincentivizes, yeah.
 - Now I'd like to tell you about our sponsor CrowdHealth.
 CrowdHealth is a Bitcoin enabled alternative
 to Legacy Health Insurance.
 Now let's face it,
 Legacy Health Insurance is an absolute scam.
 Nobody can explain this better
 than the legendary comedian, Chris Rock.
 - Insurance, you got to have some insurance.
 You got to, that's an insurance.
 They shouldn't even call it insurance.
 They should just call it in case shit.
 (audience laughing)
 I give a company some money in case shit happens.
 Now if shit don't happen, shouldn't I get my money back?
 - So with CrowdHealth,
 instead of just paying premiums
 that you'll never see again,
 you can hold part of this pool of savings
 in dollars and in Bitcoin through CrowdHealth.
 And when you have a health event,
 you can draw against this pool of communal savings.
 So go to joincrowdhealth.com/breedlove
 to learn more or sign up.
 Now I'd like to tell you about our sponsor Wasabi Wallet.
 Wasabi lets you use Bitcoin privately
 while still maintaining full control over your money.
 Specifically, Wasabi Wallet is an open source,
 non-custodial wallet with privacy built in by default.
 By using Wasabi, you're effectively putting the private
 back in private property.
 Wasabi Wallet is an easy to use privacy wallet
 that can support any amount of Bitcoin transactions.
 So go to wasabiwallet.io today
 to download this state of the art wallet software.
 Now I'd like to tell you about our sponsor, Masterworks.
 Masterworks gives you access to the fine art market
 at more affordable price points.
 They do this by offering you fractional shares
 in their $500 million portfolio of fine art.
 Now fine art is an alternative asset class
 and historically it's been a great performer
 and a really good hedge against inflation.
 Most investors typically hold anywhere from two to 10%
 of their assets in an asset like fine art.
 To sign up or learn more, go to masterworks.com
 and use promo code BREEDLOVE.
 Now I'd like to tell you about our sponsor, Kasa.
 Kasa makes it simple to buy and secure your Bitcoin
 without wondering whether you're doing it right.
 Specifically, Kasa provides a multi-key custody solution,
 which is by far the most secure way to custody your Bitcoin.
 Now, when I talk about Bitcoin being theft-proof money
 or inviolable private property,
 a multi-key custody model is exactly what I am talking about.
 Using multiple keys lets you maintain full control
 of your Bitcoin while also giving you redundancy
 in case you lose one of the keys.
 It's also the best way to secure your Bitcoin
 for inheritance planning purposes.
 So go to keys.kasa, that's C-A-S-A, today
 to sign up and use discount code BREEDLOVE.
 This trade-off relationship that exists
 between auditability and privacy,
 this is something I think a lot of people struggle
 to get their head around in Bitcoin
 because they don't understand
 why Bitcoin isn't private at layer one, right?
 Something like Monero or any of these other privacy coins.
 But you do have this trade-off, right?
 You have to optimize for supply integrity or auditability,
 which requires a certain degree of information being shared.
 But the trade-off to that obviously is privacy.
 So I guess it's layers two and above
 where we seek to add real privacy to Bitcoin.
 I mean, it sounds like Fediman's a big step
 in that direction.
 And then these Chomian e-cash tokens,
 I think is what you called them.
 They're basically fully fungible bearer assets.
 So are these like-
 - Fully fungible bearer assets
 within the context of the Federation community.
 But they cannot be used outside of the community.
 - Got it.
 So the Bitcoin that's being used to fund,
 I guess to mint those Chomian e-cash tokens,
 that Bitcoin is then just staked inside the software
 or held inside the software?
 How does that, how do you know-
 - Yes.
 - That there's a circulation, I guess?
 - Yes.
 So what happens is,
 remember the Fedimans run multiple applications
 and it comes to standard with free,
 a multi-sig Bitcoin wallet application
 that's run collectively amongst the guardians,
 what we call the guardians,
 the people running the Fediman software,
 a Chomian e-cash system that can mint Chomian e-cash
 based on certain rules and destroy it
 based on certain rules.
 And then the Lightning interface
 that effectively can emulate aspects
 of the Lightning network,
 so that Lightning nodes connecting to anyone,
 any one of the users of the Fediman
 can feel like they're operating with the Lightning network,
 even though they're not.
 So it sort of stimulates the Lightning network
 for Lightning nodes to connect to
 and interact with the users of the Fediman.
 In the case of money coming in,
 let's say someone wants to deposit on the main chain
 a certain amount of Bitcoin and be credited e-cash.
 Well, they deposit,
 the Federation of guardians
 are running the multi-sig wallet,
 an API call is made effectively to receive an address
 to send money to,
 to send Bitcoin, being the money, to.
 Bitcoin is sent into that address.
 Once it's had a number of confirmations,
 so they're comfortable, a rollback is unlikely.
 This triggers another, the Chomian e-cash operation
 to mint a certain, an equivalent number of e-cash tokens.
 So if the value of them was,
 let's say there was 1,200 sets,
 it might print one 1,000 set e-cash token
 and two 100 set e-cash tokens.
 And then it will place them temporarily in an account.
 This effectively waiting for someone to connect
 to that account with a secret.
 That secret would have been determined
 at the point of depositing the Bitcoin address.
 So only the person depositing the Bitcoin address
 would be aware of that secret.
 That same person will then come back with a secret saying,
 look, I have a secret,
 please give me the amount in this account.
 And then they would send to that user
 the amount in that account.
 So they wouldn't know who the user was.
 They just know that it must be the same person
 because they know the secret that was given
 as at the point of depositing the Bitcoin
 and the same person is now,
 or someone is coming up with a secret.
 It doesn't actually have to be the same person,
 but just like with other cryptographic and hashes and so on,
 the chance that someone could guess that secret
 is infeasibly small.
 And so it's likely to be the same person
 or someone else who that person knowingly gave the secret to
 that someone would be able to collect that.
 So that's what would happen when you deposit.
 And when you withdraw,
 someone with an e-cash token will send it to the federation
 with information saying where I'd like
 the related Bitcoin to be sent to.
 And the federation again,
 would use, would process the,
 would check the tokens coming in
 using the federated Chami and Mint
 to make sure they were signed by the multi-sig,
 that the multi-sig details
 that the federation was responsible for.
 So they can say, okay, all these e-cash tokens are valid,
 destroy those e-cash tokens,
 and then take the equivalent amount of Bitcoin
 and send it onto the address
 that the instructions provided.
 So that's how Bitcoin main chain would come in and out.
 Now, I think behind your question was what's to prevent them
 just because they're perfectly private,
 what's to prevent someone just sending in
 a different set of e-cash tokens,
 creating a different set of e-cash tokens
 and withdrawing out Bitcoin,
 or just simply withdrawing out Bitcoin
 and not redeeming any e-cash tokens,
 leaving the extra,
 leaving the Fedimint with a fraction reserve,
 i.e. less Bitcoin than the amount.
 And the only thing stopping that
 is the decision on the two things.
 One is the fact that it works in a federated manner.
 So you need to have,
 I'll give you an example.
 Let's say there are seven guardians.
 and you have a five of seven multi-sig,
 or five of seven federation setup.
 That means it needs five of them to work together
 to sign a transaction,
 or five of them to work together to mint a transaction.
 So this gives you two levels of protection.
 As long as five or more of them are running,
 the system will run.
 So it has protection from being stopped
 or being stopped, censored effectively.
 It has censorship protection of two.
 So if one goes down, the machine has failed,
 it needs to be restarted, or just completely stops,
 you will still be able to keep ticking and going on.
 If two goes down, you'll still be able to keep ticking.
 So it can support in that scenario,
 two people stopping, and it can still continue to operate,
 continue to process transactions.
 If three or more go down,
 it can no longer process transactions.
 The transactions will be stuck there
 until some of them go back online.
 But even if three go offline, or even if four,
 which is now a majority of the seven people go offline,
 if they become bad actors, four people become bad actors,
 they still cannot, they can censor,
 they can cause the, not the blockchain,
 but the FedEment to stop processing withdrawals, deposits,
 but they cannot send the money to addresses
 that they do not want to,
 they cannot print tokens out of thin air,
 'cause you need at least five.
 So you would have to get to a point where at least five
 of these seven members of the community
 became bad actors at the same time,
 within minutes of each other,
 before you could prevent, before they can actively print,
 actively perform any application,
 run any application within the FedEment.
 In this case, the relevant ones would be the e-cash token,
 minting and destruction code,
 or the Bitcoin multisig code,
 before they could actually effectively
 lead to something that was a fraction reserve bank.
 And now this is, so that's the first thing,
 just technically that gives you a level of protection
 against censorship and protection against bad actors.
 That's an even greater level of protection
 against bad actors, subverting the network.
 However, there's the other parts,
 and this is the social aspect that's really important.
 We recommend that FedEments are used in a community context.
 So it's a community where people have shared interests,
 goals, knowledge of each other,
 and they come together and choose the people who've acted,
 who have three things in common.
 One, proof of integrity.
 They've acted with integrity through the lived in experience
 to the most level of integrity,
 the lived in experience of people within that community.
 They've proof of community service.
 They've been community service oriented.
 They've always thought about what's best for the community,
 and they've acted in that.
 And then proof of passion for the community.
 They're passionate about the community.
 They care about the community.
 So if you solve for those three,
 and you use the wisdom of the community
 to locate the people who best fit that profile,
 the belief is that the inferences,
 that the likelihood that they will then
 change their character over lifedime,
 the majority of them, within a few minutes of each other,
 for me personally, there is obviously a risk,
 but if I had to choose between that and the alternative,
 which is a third party custodial exchange
 run by a stranger somewhere,
 probably on the other side of the world,
 who has no interest in me other than as a profit center,
 and I am just a statistic on a computer,
 and their sole interest is to try and extract
 as much money from me as possible,
 and I'm entrusting them with my money
 because of flashy advertising and so on.
 Out of the two, the one I have proof of punishability with,
 and the one I do not,
 the one who cares about me and has acted
 through my lived experience,
 and the experience of my community with integrity,
 and I need, and a quorum of them will have to change that,
 versus a single person who I have no idea
 what their level of integrity is,
 and maybe just the regulation is just keeping them
 from their own animalistic, selfish instinct.
 I know which one I will choose,
 but everybody's obviously up to make their own choice.
 Now, the other option is first party custody,
 and that is the gold standard,
 that's the Bitcoin standard,
 but the challenge with first party custody is threefold.
 One, there is a cost overhead.
 When you have 30 minute community custody,
 the cost of running this is amortized across the community.
 So if it's a thousand people,
 and you have five, four, five guardians,
 then you're amortizing that cost
 across a thousand, two thousand people.
 So it becomes a lot less expensive per person on average,
 whereas if it's first party custody,
 you have to bear that cost yourself.
 So the risk is you therefore underspend on it,
 so you don't do it properly,
 or it's just a cost which then limits
 how much, how affordable it is.
 If you've only got a hundred Bitcoin,
 a hundred, sorry, $100 worth of Bitcoin,
 not a hundred Bitcoin,
 you should have self custody
 if you have a hundred Bitcoin probably.
 But if you've got a hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin,
 it probably doesn't make sense to buy free hardware wallets
 and steel cards and so on, which cost you,
 you know, three, $400 to do.
 It doesn't make sense.
 Probably makes sense to you
 to pay $400 to buy more Bitcoin.
 But if you've got 10,000, 20,000,
 you might want to stop thinking about it.
 That's the second challenge is technical complexity.
 It's getting easier and easier all the time,
 but not everybody's technically minded.
 And even things that are relatively simple,
 that's why I say in my world,
 when we're talking about 8 billion users,
 even operating a set-top box
 for many hundreds of millions of people
 could be considered technically daunting.
 So for many people,
 the task of operating a hardware wallet
 or their own software wallets
 may be technically uncomfortable.
 So that's the second set of criteria.
 You have to be above a certain level of technical acumen.
 In the Bitcoin space,
 many people are highly technically comfortable,
 so they don't recognize that there's many people
 who find it very difficult to do things
 that we take for granted.
 And then the final thing is fear.
 You know, this is something that, again,
 we have to work on as a community,
 but a very large percentage,
 and this is something that shocked me,
 but I came to understand as running an exchange,
 have been taught,
 and our whole society has made us afraid
 of being able to manage our own money.
 And sometimes it's rightful.
 Some people are very clumsy and so on,
 and it's just their nature.
 And they feel that they will lose the money
 if they were asked to look after it themselves.
 So to force them to do that,
 it reconciles them to being penniless, potentially.
 But others, it's just, I think, for a larger set,
 it's culturally, we've been taught
 to be afraid to self-custody.
 And we need to teach people to have the bravery to do that.
 But that's going to take,
 this is something that you would have been taught
 throughout your entire life.
 And it's going to take time to unlearn that,
 to crack through that veil.
 And some people at a certain advanced age
 may not want to anymore.
 But the people who do want to,
 it still takes time to get to the point
 where you're comfortable with moving large amounts of money
 and taking full responsibility for your money.
 But in that interim period,
 we see this sort of influx of regulation coming in
 and ever increasing.
 We're seeing the return to the bad old days
 of exchanges and trusted third parties,
 trusted in quotes, third parties,
 taking advantage of that trust.
 And we at Ferdy and the people working
 on the FerdyMent protocol,
 don't believe we can wait for that period
 for everybody to not feel the fear of self-custody.
 And we have to make the process of getting off exchanges
 our highest priority.
 - Yeah, it makes a lot of sense to me.
 And with the, so the multi-guardians and a multi-sig,
 you're basically saying that collusion is necessary
 to gamify or to game that system.
 - Yeah.
 - That gives you a lot more resistance
 to these internal debacles versus the single guy
 running an exchange in a far off lands you described.
 That makes a lot of sense.
 And I guess the game theory too,
 there is then preserving FerdyMent as a full reserve bank.
 Is that correct?
 So it's much, there has to be some form
 of I guess, defection in this game theoretic,
 I don't know if you call it a shelling point or what,
 but basically wherever all the guardians
 are operating their own self-interest,
 someone needs to defect from that to make this thing
 become a fractional reserve bank.
 Is that correct?
 - Well, yeah.
 I mean, as I said, in the example of five of seven,
 one person decides that it's a bad actor.
 It's, they would, one risk proof of punishment,
 they're within the community context,
 an obvious form of non-violent punishment
 is just ostracized from the community, for example.
 Their machine, their FerdyMent server,
 they would then have to take the FerdyMent server software,
 patch it, modify it, reinstall.
 It would then start to operate in a manner
 which is not compatible with the rest of the system.
 I mean, not signing transactions
 that others wish to sign, et cetera.
 That would then be picked up by the other guardians servers
 and it would be kicked off.
 It would be ignored for the purposes of transactions
 until it went back in line.
 So the users of the system wouldn't notice it
 other than potentially their mobile wallets,
 just like you have Lightning wallets and Bitcoin wallets,
 their FerdyMent wallets that connect up
 to the FerdyMent network,
 would be aware that one of the seven guardians
 is no longer responding.
 It's no longer forming part of the federation.
 So they could alert the user saying,
 you can imagine a green, amber, red sort of scenario.
 So it's green when all seven are working lockstep.
 It goes to amber when it goes down to six, for example.
 And then if one more did the same.
 thing, it could go down to red saying, "You've got five of seven guardians on," and that
 could be, it won't know whether it's not operating in line with the others as a bad actor or
 if it's just offline because it's being restarted.
 But it might sort of temporarily, you might see someone restart the machine and for a
 few minutes it goes from green to amber and then back.
 But you could also imagine code in future versions that people have discussed where
 if the number, if it goes down to amber and it stays there for a certain period of time
 or goes down to red, you automatically create a lightning transaction which sends all your
 money to another federation.
 Because just like the user experience of using the app is very similar to the user experience
 of something like, at least with the Fedi app, each Fedi Min Aware wallet will implement
 their user experience differently.
 They're not the only, Fedi doesn't make the only Fedimint wallet.
 There are at least two others I'm aware of.
 And we expect, just like there are multiple Lightning wallets, there'll be multiple Fedi
 Mint wallets because it's an open source protocol.
 But with our ones, the experience is very much like Slack.
 So you can be part of, or Discord, multiple Slacks, you can be part of multiple Fedi
 Mints.
 And you can imagine a family Fedimint where you might store more money and a close friend's
 Fedimint, but also your work Fedimint.
 Instead of paying your employees and everybody has to figure out their own federation, you
 could do that.
 Some Bitcoin exchanges in Africa are considering creating Fedimints in conjunction where
 they have one of the guardians, but then a consortium of other respected institutions
 within the community are the other guardians.
 And so this becomes an inexpensive way of allowing their customers to self custody without
 telling them to buy hardware wallets, et cetera, which could be relatively expensive for their
 target customers.
 And then if you go to a larger level, we're seeing potentially the idea of cities or small
 towns setting up Fedimints or even groups, for example, charities and human rights, defender
 groups and NGOs and activist groups who are supporting whole movements.
 Again, these people have had a history of not taking money from their customers, from
 their users, but actually working hard and risking their lives to generate money and
 give money to large members of the society they're trying to help.
 So if they're actively giving their money and donating and raising and spending, they're
 unlikely to want to steal the money that they themselves donated, for example.
 So you can see groups that are as much as hundreds of thousands of people at the large
 scale or maybe even greater, because again, there's no way to actually know how many people
 as members of the federation, all the way down to groups of a group of friends who are
 highly technical Bitcoiners who all want to maintain, they trust each other to hold their
 backups of their keys.
 And they might just determine why don't we just create a federation of the five of us
 where each of us effectively is having each other's back.
 We don't invite anyone external other than me, but you'll probably find it will start
 to expand slowly because when they become the Uncle Jim's of their family, and say,
 well, you might as well just join our federation, you might as well just join.
 And there will be no way for any of the other guardians to know anyway.
 But the Sabir Kure is smallest four people, effectively own guardians and being the users
 for each other.
 And effectively, the other three are the backups for them, each other, they're having each
 other's back all the way up to hundreds of thousands of people run by activist groups
 or NGOs and so on, and everything in between.
 It's really fascinating, the idea of these little communities just organically growing
 and becoming Bitcoin unions of some kind.
 I don't know, it's interesting to think about it that way.
 And then so I guess the punchline there is there are significant barriers to gaming the
 system.
 You know, technical barriers, game theoretic, communal.
 So you're just creating a model of Bitcoin custody, privacy and payments that's more
 human friendly, ultimately.
 Very interesting.
 Can we talk a little bit about the vision?
 So ultimately, this federated and community based approach to custody has a number of
 really powerful elements.
 It is built on this foundation of privacy.
 And because of the way it's structured in most reasonable jurisdictions, no, it's exempt
 from regulation, federation, once the federation is set up, setting up a federation can take
 as little as five to ten minutes.
 But once it's set up for a normal user, the onboarding experience is the same as the experience
 of sharing your contact details with a QR code on something like WhatsApp or Telegram.
 It literally takes seconds.
 In fact, when our first live transactions, the buying the cup of coffee, we did in Hacker's
 Congress this year because we sponsored it because a year before was where myself and
 my co-founders first met.
 And it was like in honor of the location, we decided to sponsor it.
 When we were first testing, the signup process was so quick.
 People thought that there was a bug in the code because they would scan the QR code and
 see a zero.
 And they thought there was a problem.
 The zero was the zero balance because you just logged in.
 And they didn't realize they'd logged in because it was so fast.
 So the feedback was we have to slow down the signing process because it's just too fast.
 But the point here is that you instantly have a community, you instantly can sign in, well,
 you can sign in in seconds.
 Transactions within the Federation are because guardians are running it for the community.
 They're not earning money from it.
 Transactions within the Federation are free.
 You have the ability to roll out to thousands of people, a community at a time, not a person
 at a time, but a community at a time.
 And let's just say a community is a thousand, 10,000 people.
 We have numbers for this based on a call that we made to community leaders on September
 the 1st of 2022, which was, and we asked community leaders to fill in actually quite a lengthy
 form explaining why we should work with them to beta test the software, to beta test, not
 to roll out the software, to beta test it.
 And we were looking for one to three people, communities and community leaders.
 After six weeks, we had several dozen, I think it was about 60, 65 communities representing
 nearly a million people.
 It was about 800 instances on the summit.
 And so that shows you the power of talking to people and rolling out to the community
 at a time.
 But then you have to understand that the other experience was that hackers.
 Sorry, there was a little bit of latency and it cut off right when you were saying about
 a million people, maybe 10 seconds ago.
 So it's about a million people.
 So in fact, the number was 860, 60 something thousands.
 These were people who weren't just clicking a box to say they're interested.
 They were filling in a multi page form and advocating for why they should be included
 in the beta testing program.
 So one of the most powerful things about FedEase and FedEment is its ability or ability to
 sign up people at rapid scale.
 So we can have global scale rapidly.
 And the reason for that, again, is the community context.
 So to give you two examples of why, first of all, we on our site, September the 1st,
 we put out a call to community leaders to hyper bitcoinize their communities.
 Now this wasn't just a ticking the box exercise, say I'm interested.
 People had to fill in a multi part form to advocate for why they should be included.
 And we wanted one to three communities to apply to roll out our beta test of the product,
 which will come out in early 2023.
 And after six weeks, by the middle of October, we had several dozen communities.
 I think it was about 60 to 65.
 And they were the communities when we totaled them up, totaled nearly a million people,
 like 800 north of 860,000 people.
 And that's in six weeks and people continue to apply still.
 And so that shows you the power and the speed at which you can bring on on board people,
 if you are looking to roll out a community at a time as opposed to imagine trying to
 go off and individually on board each one of those 80 60,000 people.
 So that's the first aspect, the community focus of rollout.
 And the second aspect is because the app is so simple to sign up and use.
 In fact, it's so simple that, as I said before, some users initially didn't even realize they
 signed up, it was that quick.
 And you don't have to go through all the overhead and friction that's related to running a regulated
 service.
 We're able to onboard people incredibly quickly.
 So again, in Hackers Congress in Prague, 2022, we were sponsors of that event, because as
 an homage to where we first met the year before in 2021, in Hackers Congress, the founders
 of the company.
 And we created the first Fedimint, temporary Fedimint network there.
 And people who came to the event could sign up, download, not the Fedi app, it was a
 competing app.
 But we actually helped support the competing app, because we want as much competition of
 apps as possible in this space.
 It drives us harder, and we have to prove our work even more.
 And that's how you should compete, not by creating various entries, just by being the
 best.
 But it was an alternative app.
 In fact, it was called Flutter Mint.
 And people would download the Flutter Mint app, and we would credit them, the Lightning
 Network, with a certain amount of stats, so they can buy the proverbial cup of coffee
 or beer, if they were so inclined.
 Now, in that vent we had...
 A good few hundred people come along to Haka's Congress and people online, because there
 was a website related to the fedi movement as well.
 So anybody who was online and saw the website, which we advertised on Twitter, could scan
 the QR code on the website and join the federation.
 Now here's the thing, we have no idea how many people join the federation because it's
 perfectly private.
 There's no way for us to know.
 But we do know at least how many people in the events that came into the room that we
 had for the fedi-mint and fedi service.
 And so we could see that we could have very easily signed up, even manually, just getting
 people to scan the QR code.
 You could have got hundreds of people to sign up in a matter of hours.
 You could imagine getting, because it's again decentralized, because each person who downloads
 the app can then, just like you share your contact details on Telegram or WhatsApp, can
 share with someone else.
 You share it with 10 people, they can then go off and share it each with 10 people, and
 they can go and share each with 10 people, and they can share each with 10 people.
 Three or four of those shares with 10 people along the line and you've got a hundred thousand
 a million users.
 And the overhead to do that for the guardians would be negligible to zero.
 And in fact, there's ways of doing that where you can join, potentially, that's not how
 it's currently designed, but the overhead is minimal.
 But you can make it so that you can join without even initially having to make any contact
 with the guardian.
 So there would be no bottleneck in your speed of being able to sign up.
 It's just as quickly as someone can get their friends to scan a QR code.
 And if you look at social, look at apps that have the fastest rates of growth, they tend
 to be social apps that work in a community context with a very, very short sign up time.
 And that's what we have done with money, with Fedi and FediMint.
 It's naturally community oriented.
 So you have a network of people to share it with.
 And the sign up process is incredibly quick.
 You do not need to enter your KYC details.
 You do not even need to enter your email address or phone number.
 You just need to download the app, scan a QR code, and you're done.
 And because of those two things, the speed at which you can roll out within a community
 and the focus on rolling out a community at a time, because it naturally gets its superpowers
 from being within a community, mean that we are able to roll out incredible scale.
 So because we can do this, coming back to your question, and it's a long segue, but
 it's really important.
 It leads us to a vision.
 We and we state this on our site, we aim at global Bitcoin adoption.
 And we want to do that at rapid speed.
 In fact, our stated objective is to have a billion users using Bitcoin in the next couple
 of years.
 And that's very achievable, because of the fact the sign up process takes seconds.
 And it's by its very nature, communal and viral.
 That is amazing.
 Very cool.
 Very cool.
 What I mean, the actual functionality, right, you're actually kind of, again, as you said
 earlier on, we're complementing the Bitcoin open source stack, right?
 We're addressing the weak spots of Bitcoin basically through this, the Federment federated
 model, and then also aiming at very rapid, large scale rollout.
 That's something to be excited about, for sure.
 Yeah, Obi, there is a lot of these conversations.
 I want to say something on that, because there was a question you asked tonight.
 And it relates to this, which was around privacy.
 And you talked about one country, one city and another.
 And this was actually something that every time I get involved in talking to people about
 this, I discover new things.
 And some of the discoveries came from conversations with, for example, Rene Picard, where he talked
 about the scaling of the Lightning Network.
 And later on with people, other members of the community working directly on the Lightning
 Network.
 And what we realized is that Lightning obviously provides a massive level of scaling over Bitcoin
 and a significant improvement in privacy.
 But there are still shortcomings in privacy, which are being worked on.
 And there are still limitations on scaling.
 It turns out that this vision of the world that we are working on for this mass rollout
 of federations, so each federation is federated, but we expect in the fullness of time, hundreds
 of thousands, or if not millions of federations.
 So that's actually a decentralized network of federated Xiaomi and Mints connected to
 each other.
 Obviously by the Bitcoin mainnet, but also by the Lightning Network.
 That actually leads to a scenario which allows usage of the Lightning Network to scale.
 It also has the potential to make using the Lightning Network, being a Lightning node
 on the Lightning Network far more lucrative.
 And finally, it provides much, much higher levels of privacy for users of the Lightning
 Network and the main chain.
 So in the example of privacy specifically, within a federation, let's say that federation
 is Las Vegas.
 Within that federation, you have perfect privacy.
 If there is another federation, say Reno, within that federation, you have perfect privacy.
 Now let's say between Reno and Las Vegas, there's a road that connects them, a massive
 Lightning Network, a main channel.
 And then there's another road that comes off that road to a private mansion, the Breedlove
 mansion.
 And that's effectively self-custody with your own Lightning, self-sovereign Bitcoin node
 and Lightning node, and you're handling all your channel rebalancing.
 And just like your own private road and your own private mansion, you're going to be overhead
 to manage that compared to the overhead to manage an apartment block in a city.
 It's going to be much higher.
 But if you're capable of doing that, and you're capable of guarding yourself and managing
 yourself, you should do it.
 It's definitely the best.
 But even though Lightning has far higher privacy guarantees than using the main network, there
 is still some leakage of information.
 So imagine you had an eavesdropper monitoring traffic on these roads, the Lightning network.
 If you were to send a payment from the Breedlove mansion to Las Vegas, that would be the equivalent
 of a car or a messenger going from the Breedlove mansion to Las Vegas.
 Let's say there's another mansion called Obi mansion, and that again was fully self-sovereign
 with its own Lightning node.
 If you were going to send a car from Breedlove mansion to Obi mansion, someone snooping the
 network will realize that a car has gone from Breedlove mansion to Obi mansion.
 Now, if on the other hand, you were sending that to Las Vegas to someone, I have a Pierre
 Deterre in an apartment in Las Vegas, someone eavesdropping the network will know that someone
 from Breedlove mansion, i.e. Breedlove, has sent a car to someone in Las Vegas.
 They just won't know who that someone is.
 And then if you have a Pierre Deterre in an apartment in Reno, and I have an apartment
 in Las Vegas, as well as my own mansions, then if I were to send a car from my apartment
 to yours, someone eavesdropping the Lightning network will know that someone, they don't
 know who, but someone in Las Vegas has sent a car to someone in Reno, and that's all they
 will know.
 And so even if you're self-sovereign, it will make sense that if you're going to do your
 daily spending, you don't do it from Breedlove mansion, you send the money you need for the
 day and you go to town in Las Vegas.
 And then as the saying goes, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
 And it's the same for this.
 Even the governor or whatever it is, I'm not sure about the structures in the US and governmental
 systems, but the governor of Las Vegas, pardon me if I'm wrong, the senator of Las Vegas,
 whatever it is, or the board, the committee who manage Las Vegas, have also, because of
 Chowmey and Mint, E-cash protocol, have no idea who is doing what in Las Vegas as well.
 It still makes sense to do your daily driving from there, i.e. the interactions you want
 to happen in Las Vegas, if they stay in Las Vegas, then it's completely private.
 And even if they go out of Las Vegas, someone monitoring the network will only know that
 someone within Las Vegas performed that transaction.
 So it provides much, much better privacy for an increased simpler user experience compared
 to you making all your payments directly from your Lightning wallet.
 So you'll store 95 or 99.9% of your value there.
 But when you want to spend, send it to your FediMint wallet and spend from there.
 In the worst case, if you were to lose that, it's the same as losing your purse out on
 an evening.
 So it gives you much better privacy guarantees.
 That's super cool.
 Yeah.
 The higher guarantee you get on privacy just by interfacing with these other, I guess,
 other anonymity sets, right?
 Just participating in the federated model.
 That's super cool.
 Yeah.
 We like to call them privacy sets, but yeah.
 Privacy sets.
 Got it.
 Obi, man, awesome conversation.
 There's a few more points here I think we could go through, which I guess we'll have
 to save for next time.
 In the meantime, could you please, I think we did this last time, but just in case my
 audience didn't hear, could you please let my audience know where they can find out more
 about you or your work?
 So thanks.
 To find out more about me, you can, as usual, find me on Twitter.
 So I'm simply @obii, @obi on Twitter.
 But also to find out more about Fedi, the company, it's F-E-D-I dot X-Y-Z.
 And then the protocol, the FediMint protocol that powers Fedi, FediMint, F-E-D-I-M-I-N-T
 dot org.
 Those are the best places to find out about me and about us.
 Fantastic.
 We'll include that in the show notes and I will see you again here next time.
 Thanks very much.
 you
