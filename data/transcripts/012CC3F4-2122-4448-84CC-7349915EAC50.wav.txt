 Then you have this middle ground, which is community custody.
 Think of it as the idea where first party custody is not your keys, not your coins.
 This is not our keys, not our coins.
 Hi, I'm Natalie Brunel.
 Thanks so much for checking out the Coin Stories podcast, where we get to hear from experts
 on Bitcoin, investing, financial markets, and the current state of the economy.
 This podcast does not provide financial advice.
 It is for educational and entertainment purposes only.
 This episode wouldn't be possible without my partners.
 First up, OKCoin.
 OKCoin is one of the fastest growing and most secure global cryptocurrency exchanges where
 you can buy and learn about Bitcoin.

 Well, Obi, first of all, thank you so much.
 I am honored to get to talk to you because I've heard nothing but amazing things from
 the likes of Jeff Booth and Greg Foss, Preston.
 I mean, everyone seems to love you in the Bitcoin space.
 Well, thank you.
 The honor is mine, by the way.
 Jeff and the guys talk very highly about you as well.
 So it's the first time we've talked ever and I hope it's going to be a really enjoyable
 experience.
 I'm so excited to learn more about you.
 So let's take it all the way back.
 I understand that your family, you are from Nigeria.
 So tell me a little bit about your young life and growing up there.
 So actually, my heritage is from Nigeria.
 I was conceived in Nigeria, but I was born in the UK.
 So I always like to say my mother made it to Heathrow Airport and I combat rolled down
 the stairs into London.
 But as I grew up, I would go back very frequently from a very young age, as long as I can remember.
 And it's a tale of two worlds, because on one hand, you're growing up in the first world
 and all the accoutrements of the first world.
 And then you go back to Nigeria and you have daily power cuts, sometimes lasting several
 days.
 You have to help out.
 Cooking involves taking actual live chickens and cutting their necks.
 In the garden at the back of the house, you have to do chores, which involved walking
 for very long distances.
 And generally, by the time you got back, you were as a young kid, you were begging for
 the luxury of the first world.
 Oh, wow.
 Well, so what did your parents do?
 Why the back and forth?
 How did they end up in the UK?
 It's quite common.
 My father had a number of businesses that he'd set up in Nigeria.
 In fact, when he was young, the Nigerian education system at the time was such where you didn't
 necessarily have a right to go to secondary school.
 You had to either pay for it or you had to attain a certain level.
 And my father being the son of, again, this was way back, but there was a period of time
 where polygamy was legal in Nigeria.
 So my grandfather had multiple wives.
 You could also inherit wives as well.
 So the oldest son would inherit his.
 It was a different time.
 So my father was the son of one of the least favored inherited wives.
 So when it came out to doling out money for different things, he was normally last in
 the line.
 It was very much.
 Wow.
 That's fascinating.
 Yeah.
 So one of those things was, even though he was incredibly gifted and an exceptional student,
 my grandfather for many years, this is a story I've never actually said to anyone before,
 but my grandfather for many years, who, by the way, I inherited his middle name because
 I was the first son, I was the first grandson born after his death and under Igbo tradition,
 I would inherit his name.
 But he refused to let my, to pay for my father to go to secondary school.
 So for many years, he was held back, even though he was incredibly gifted until some
 teachers saw his capability and literally begged my grandfather to let him go to secondary
 school.
 And he, he achieved that, but only on the condition that every year when they had to
 take exams for the next year, he had to be the best.
 And so he had to be the best in that entire region of Nigeria every single year to make
 it through to the following year, which he did.
 And he went on to set up a very successful set of businesses in property and real estate
 in Nigeria.
 But you're still, you're, if you think about the, the Cantilong effect and being far away
 from the money spigot, well, if you're in the developing world, you're the furthest
 possible away.
 And he knew with his sort of finance training, because he studied in finance, that you needed
 to get to an economy which was closer to the spigot.
 And so he sold everything or almost everything to, to move to the UK.
 My mother, they came back to Nigeria when I was conceived, but still, he sold everything
 and had to start from scratch.
 So he was here to start in some of the most menial jobs, he had to be a janitor, he had
 to be a caretaker, take three or four jobs at the same time, even though he was more
 qualified than everybody in the companies that he was providing the work for, which
 is a common story when you're a first generation.
 So yeah, that's, that's my mother again, was one of the, well, I, not one of, she's the
 hardest working person I've ever met.
 Elon Musk has nothing on her.
 And I got a tiny portion of her work ethic, and hopefully some of the intellect of my
 father as well to combine together.
 Wow, that is incredible.
 You know, I relate in the sense that I also saw my parents working really, really hard
 first generation immigrants here.
 How did that impact you?
 Did you grow up thinking, I have to, you know, succeed, I have to gain financial security,
 because I don't know, for me, it was like, I want to make them proud.
 I also don't want to, I don't want to have a family and have them suffer some of the
 financial issues that I had growing up.
 So what, what was it like?
 What was the impact on you growing up?
 Yeah, I think, I mean, they, I always say they are, they were hard working, working
 class Nigerian parents.
 So that had multiple aspects.
 When I was growing up in the West in the UK, but I still had this sort of Nigerian focus
 on academic excellence, you know, and the expectation that you had to, I was effectively
 a low performer by not getting a doctorate, almost every other Nigerian is a doctor of
 this or doctor of that.
 So I went to obviously went to university, but that's a very much entrenched into the
 culture, you respect age and you respect academic achievement.
 So that was one thing, the work ethic, as I said, of both, especially my mother, she
 was incredibly hard working, affected me and, and, and has lived with me ever since.
 So I like to think I'm a very, very hard worker as a result.
 And just generally seeing the sacrifices they made for us, for the family, at least in my
 case made me feel that I, I wanted to, at the very least, try to live up to what they,
 what they achieved.
 And my view was also, again, going backwards and forwards between Nigeria and the UK, I
 realized that I was incredibly lucky.
 I was lucky to be born, especially when I went back to Nigeria to be born a man, I was
 lucky that my father made it through this sort of very, very low probability set of
 circumstances to make it to the UK.
 Because when I saw his brothers who, and the children of his brothers, they were all direct
 cousins, but everyone is about at least half a foot shorter than me, for example, even
 though you can see the difference between the cousins who are in America, who maybe,
 I would say a couple of inches taller on average, the people in in the UK are around six foot,
 and everybody in Nigeria is like five, five.
 And that's purely to do with, you know, food and nourishment and environment and pollution
 and so on.
 Struggling to survive.
 And whereas I'm in the UK, because of all of this circumstance, healthy, not having
 to deal with the challenges of, you know, there's a number of challenges to life and
 liberty you have living in somewhere like Nigeria.
 So I realized I was incredibly lucky just to be born here.
 And so the least I could do is work really, really hard to try and achieve as much as
 I can from that opportunity.
 Yeah, that's amazing.
 Was there a sense of, I need to help, or your family needs to help your family in Nigeria?
 And how did you think about money back then?
 So I think that there was a sense that we needed to help.
 But it was also a double edged thing.
 On one hand, as many families did, a large percentage of our capital would go back to
 the diaspora.
 But on the other hand, time and again, you would see people just waste the money and
 just it would stay, it would say, it wouldn't last in their hands very, very long.
 And it became very clear that there were these deep rooted, just deep rooted aspects of the
 environment and the education around money or the lack or the mis-education around money
 that were apparent in the West, but even more apparent in the global South.
 That meant that it was very hard for people to build wealth.
 So this wasn't just a problem of lack of money, but it's also lack of monetary education.
 Sure.
 Well, so what got you interested in computers?
 Because I know that you ended up studying computer and cognitive science.
 So were you kind of tinkering around that type of technology when you were young and
 thinking this is what I want to do?
 So I mean, I'm 47.
 So when I was a kid, we were working class.
 We couldn't afford computers,
 which were very, very expensive at the time.
 But I went to, I remember very clearly,
 the first day of secondary school.
 I don't know what you call that in the US.
 - High school?
 - Is that, high school, high school.
 - How old were you?
 - The first year, I was 12, I think it's 12.
 - Okay, so that's like middle school, yeah.
 - Yeah, middle school, middle school.
 So you go from 12 all the way to 18 is high school.
 - We have middle school
 and then high school a lot of places, so.
 - Okay, so middle school,
 the first day you'd go into the assembly
 and the headmaster would come in and say,
 "Hey, hello to the new class."
 And at the end, they encouraged us
 to try some afterschool activities,
 to broaden our horizons.
 So I was like, "Fine, you did your first day of school,
 got to know people."
 And I looked at some of the arts and crafts activities
 and I saw there was this chess club.
 And I thought, "Well, my parents would like that,
 education, academic achievement.
 Let me join the chess club."
 So I joined the, I went into the chess club
 and it was 3.30 and at four o'clock,
 I was in the middle of a move on the chess board
 and everybody ran out of the room
 and including the person I was playing against.
 And we were mid game and I went,
 "Where's everybody going?"
 And they went, "Computer club."
 So it was this computer club thing.
 I followed them in and I saw these computers
 and everybody's playing this game.
 It's a bit like Donkey Kong.
 And at that point I was smitten.
 I just wanted to know how this thing worked.
 I was the last person to leave.
 I was joined by the computer science teachers
 who were amazing,
 recognized that I was really interested in this
 and helped me learn about programming.
 I started programming games.
 And before I finished secondary school, high school,
 I was building neural networks.
 And I programmed the neural network
 to sort of add numbers together
 and learn the concept of addition.
 I then entered university
 and it was around the same time
 I joined an organization called Mensa.
 I think I was one of the younger people at the time.
 I entered university about a year early
 and they didn't really have computers,
 AI as a subject,
 but you could construct it
 with a combination of computer science
 and cognitive science, which they did.
 And I continued my love for computers.
 And at that point it was still an AI.
 I built a neural network that would read your brainwaves
 and control a mouse cursor and stuff like this.
 But then halfway through my university,
 the internet and the World Wide Web
 really became a big thing.
 And NCSA Mosaic, which was the precursor to Mozilla,
 came out and the world of the internet became open to you.
 And at that time, a number of us realized
 that this thing was going to be very, very big.
 You'd opened up the internet.
 Before it was this sort of closed room.
 And I just became infatuated with the internet.
 I worked on the first...
 So we saw a website by the BBC,
 which was a terrible tech site.
 And one of us mailed them saying,
 that site's really bad
 and you can maybe make some changes.
 And then someone replied to us,
 this is in the early to mid nineties,
 and saying, well, I'm the only person in the BBC
 working on this internet thing.
 Could you help me?
 And so we met them in a pub
 and we built this site for BBC radio.
 And from there, I just entered this career
 of being in the UK and European dot-com space, dot-com one.
 I was the first or the second employee
 for a very successful,
 that went on to be a very successful dot-com startup
 that was sold for 2 billion pounds.
 So several years later,
 and then I was around the dot-com too.
 So I was the CTO for a massively multi-player virtual world.
 I joined, we had about four or five million users.
 When I left, we had about 30 million users.
 It was very popular in the US.
 It was called WeWorld, Weemees, these little characters.
 - Oh wow.
 - These virtual characters,
 they were like Habbo Hotel and Club Penguin.
 And then I decided to work for myself
 'cause I realized I'd been helping many other people
 become very successful.
 I did okay for myself,
 but I became an entrepreneur and I started my entrepreneurship.
 - Yeah, I mean, it sounds like being a part
 of the revolution that was the internet so early.
 I mean, from what you're saying,
 it sounds like you could have just retired
 if you were some of the earliest employees,
 but you wanted to keep working or?
 - I don't think I could have.
 I did well, but I don't think I could have retired,
 I guess, but even so,
 I definitely am someone who cannot,
 I've tried before, I'm now in a position for quite a while
 where I could retire, but I've tried it
 and it doesn't last, it doesn't take very well.
 It doesn't last, like this year, early this year,
 I promised off the selling coin floor to take,
 a couple of years off and that didn't last very long.
 I think that lasted about two months.
 I went to Mexico for a month
 and I went to Indonesia for six weeks
 and I learned to scuba dive and that was it,
 that was enough, I needed to go
 and start actually doing something that for me was valuable
 and helped the lives of others.
 - Well, that makes you a real Bitcoiner
 because I think that when you are just in repose
 or you're just giving into pleasure,
 your life doesn't have as much purpose,
 whereas if you're working, it gives you some meaning.
 So, well, just out of curiosity,
 before we go into coin floor and a little bit of Bitcoin,
 were you essentially helping build these sites
 and platforms or what were you actually doing?
 What was your role for all these companies?
 - So for all of these companies, it was always technical.
 So the first company, I was the second employee
 and I came on to help build this online auction company.
 It was like a European version of eBay at the time.
 And it was initially me, the founder and one other,
 it was literally one of these startups
 was in a room above a garage where if a phone call came in
 and cars were coming in, you had to put it on mute
 because it would shake the entire room.
 That's how we started.
 And I built the first version of this site.
 We had a lot of success, it grew,
 but the site first version needed to be re-architected.
 So I re-architected and built the second version of the site
 for this time with a team of five
 and it re-architected and re-grew again, 10, 100X.
 And then the third version of the site,
 I had a team of 150 and that all happened in 18 months.
 I went from myself to 150 employees
 just in technology alone.
 And I said, in my early twenties,
 I learned a lot about managing teams, managing rapid growth.
 We were dealing with huge amounts of auction transactions
 and very large amounts of value being traded.
 And so, yeah, and then we rolled out across Europe.
 And then another company I was in, which was another.com,
 but it was an online travel company for four years.
 And again, I was head of technology,
 chief application architect,
 and we built out a number of firsts there as well,
 rolled out all across Europe
 until we were eventually bought by Sendon
 who owned Orbitz and Avis and this very large group.
 - So is this what they refer to as like web 1.0 or web 2.0?
 Is that essentially what it is?
 - Web 1.0 is, I would say is e-commerce,
 which is sites that are either informational
 or they allow you to buy and transact.
 Web 2.0 is where you have the social elements.
 So Facebook or massive multiplayer virtual worlds
 where people actually are communicating with other people
 as opposed to web 1 is you're communicating with the service
 and you're getting some service
 and there could be a million people using the service
 or two, you don't really know, you just know the service.
 With web 2.0, it only gets its power
 if there are a lot of other people using it.
 So Facebook, if it was just Johnny Nobates,
 then it's not a very fun site.
 And web, well, web 3.0, that's now being hijacked.
 So we don't need to talk about that too much.
 - Okay, well, maybe we'll circle back just
 'cause I think a lot of people,
 they catch onto that buzzword and they're like,
 oh, web 3.0, it'll solve all of our problems.
 But okay, so how did you come to create, build CoinFloor?
 'Cause I heard you with Preston
 talking about how you heard about Bitcoin
 when it was like a hundred dollars or so
 and then you crashed back down.
 You didn't really take it seriously.
 Then all of a sudden you come back to it
 and it had gone up to a couple hundred dollars.
 You were like, hey, this technology might actually work.
 So tell me a little bit more
 about that journey and CoinFloor.
 - Yeah, so as I said, I was obviously a card carrying geek.
 I worked in the computing space.
 I studied computer science.
 I always continue to spend hours reading up on,
 other than Bitcoin, I'm reading up on AI and so on.
 I separate to that because of this experience
 of where I came from and seeing these two worlds.
 I was aware of, and I would wax lyrical about the iniquity,
 the unfairness in the world.
 And the reason, but this is interesting.
 The reason I had a problem with it
 was a very much an engineering,
 engineers efficiency mindset
 in that the world is losing out.
 Right now on this planet,
 there's probably 50 Einsteins somewhere.
 And because they're not providing value to the world,
 we, everybody is losing out.
 So we need ways to surface that talent up
 so that that talent,
 those talented individuals, wherever they are,
 and they're likely not all going to be
 in Western Europe and North America,
 wherever they are, they can add value to the world.
 We will need, there's probably a dozen Elon Musk's,
 a dozen Einstein's out there.
 We need to find them and have them helping us.
 So therefore I just thought,
 I just found it really depressing
 that the world didn't have a way
 of surfacing that efficiency.
 So when I, when Bitcoin came along,
 at least two different friends sent me links
 very close to each other about this thing.
 You should read it because it's,
 it's the world's first meritocratic money.
 And it's this incredible technology.
 And so Obi will definitely find this interesting.
 And so, and I did, I read the white paper.
 This was in 2011, actually two years before CoinFlow.
 And I read the white paper and actually
 I found the technology really, really interesting,
 but maybe I was cynical at the time.
 I thought, well, governments are going to kill this thing.
 It's not going to last very long.
 I'd buy a bit and I bought a little bit.
 And I, and it was, it was a set like under a hundred dollars
 it was in the nineties or so on.
 And then it crashed down to two, three, $4.
 And I'm like, okay, yes, see what I mean?
 It's not going to last.
 Anyway, I was running my previous business at the time.
 Two years later, that business was being wound up
 and my soon to be co-founder who had,
 I'd angel invested in a previous business,
 came to me and said, look, there's this Bitcoin thing.
 We should try and look at doing something with this.
 I went, Bitcoin is still around, let me check.
 And the price was in the several hundred.
 And I thought, okay, so it's really,
 really interesting technology.
 It's a credit money as well.
 It doesn't matter who you are.
 If you can acquire it, you have the same protections
 afforded to you no matter where you are and so on.
 And that's all you need, a level playing field.
 And then we can service the right people.
 And it has staying power.
 We need to do something here.
 And that's when we launched CoinFlow.
 And the rest was history from there.
 - I mean, that's amazing.
 So tell us a little bit more about that company
 'cause it was the biggest Bitcoin only exchange in the UK.
 Right, is it still?
 - No, I mean, it's been sold and it was an asset sale.
 So all of the customer base is sold
 and have been subsumed into other companies.
 In fact, there are two parts.
 One faithful part was spun off a few years ago.
 It was called CoinFlower X.
 We made the world's first physically delivered
 Bitcoin futures exchange.
 And that was sold to a consortium of Chicago trading firms
 and Hong Kong based proprietary trading firms as well.
 And it was renamed after being sold to CoinFlex,
 which you may have heard in the news now more recently.
 So that, but we sold that.
 And more recently we had a remaining stake
 and we sold that just before selling.
 And the other part was a Bitcoin only spot,
 Bitcoin only exchange.
 And that's the customer base and users, et cetera,
 was sold to Coin Corner 'cause that was a,
 I know the guys there, they're great people.
 And they were, although we had multiple suitors,
 I really wanted to sell it to someone
 who was philosophically aligned to us.
 But as a background, we launched in 2013.
 Again, it was in, it was actually just off Hatton Garden,
 which is famous for the gold area of London,
 which is quite good 'cause we were making this digital gold.
 And around the corner from Charles Street Lane,
 which mentioned the law, which is like,
 Bitcoin is law as well.
 So we just loved the feng shui of the area.
 And we always stayed around that place.
 You've got this sort of law and where code is law
 and gold all together.
 And we started with one desk shared by three people
 and we slowly grew and grew as a company
 until we, at our peak,
 we're doing 70% of the trade volume in the UK.
 And in that time, it was this roller coaster.
 I always say that first you ignore you,
 then they love you, then they fight you, then you win.
 When we launched, we were at the tail end
 of what I could call the Bitcoin was ignored period.
 I actually have this pin tweet on my Twitter,
 which I tweeted in 2020,
 which I still believe more so than ever is correct,
 which was 2008 to 2013, Bitcoin was ignored.
 2013 to 2018, Bitcoin was really called and laughed at.
 And 2018 to 2023, where we are right now,
 Bitcoin is attacked.
 And in 2023, next year to infinity,
 Bitcoin wins.
 And I'm actually more convinced than ever
 that next year will be the year Bitcoin clearly wins.
 But when we launched, Bitcoin was still being ignored.
 And then we had another run up in price
 and Bitcoin started to be ridiculed at that point.
 And we were, the first five years, people always,
 especially in the city of London, just laughing.
 And I was saying, this is just a joke.
 Maybe the blockchain thing is useful,
 but the rest is a waste of time.
 And, but we kept on pushing through
 and we kept on growing until 2018.
 Again, we went through the Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash wars,
 many other exchanges decided,
 wanted to back this SegWit2x protocol.
 We were one of the few exchanges that said, no,
 we are going to go where the majority of users will go.
 And that is what Bitcoin is,
 not what we as an exchange decided what Bitcoin is.
 And we had many firsts like that.
 We were the first exchange to provide
 an uninterrupted set of provable solvency audits.
 We did it for eight years straight
 and we always lobbied other exchanges
 to do the same thing as well.
 And we were also one of the first exchanges
 to maintain going Bitcoin only.
 We listed Ethereum for nine months.
 And after nine months, I thought that was enough.
 And we went back and we made a very big stand
 that we're going to go Bitcoin only
 and nothing else is in the best interest of our customers.
 And we focused on that.
 It was one of the best decisions we ever made
 and we continued to progress until we sold the company.
 - We are going to take a quick break from the show
 to hear these messages from my partners.
 First up, are you ready
 for an international Bitcoin conference?
 Here's a look at Miami 2022,
 but Bitcoin Magazine and the team
 that brought you the world's largest Bitcoin conference
 is bringing the mission of hyper-Bitcoinization global
 with the inaugural European gathering this fall.
 Bitcoin Amsterdam will take place

 Head to foldapp.com/natalie.
 And when you sign up, you get 5,000 sats.
 Now back to the show.
 We continue to progress until we sold the company
 at the end of last year. Amazing.
 Okay, well, two questions about that
 that I think are really important
 for the viewers and listeners.
 Number one, why Bitcoin only?
 As someone who really understands the technology
 and has this background in computer science.
 And number two, can you offer maybe like a 30,000 foot view
 of running an exchange today?
 We hear about so many that have had liquidity issues
 and maybe they were doing something
 with the coins that were held.
 I mean, can you just kind of explain what happened?
 'Cause clearly you didn't run into those issues.
 No, we didn't.
 And that was one of the very big reason
 why I decided ultimately,
 most people are not aware of the risk they take
 in most cases.
 There's always exceptions,
 but in most cases holding money on exchanges.
 And we need to get most people off exchanges stats
 to use an Americanism.
 So, but in terms of why we decided to go Bitcoin only,
 I mean, philosophically behind there's two sides.
 One, behind the scenes, we had two co-founders
 and I think one was more aligned
 with there was a growing schism
 because one was more aligned with Bitcoin cash
 and multiple coins, just philosophically.
 And the other, and offering very, very complex
 financial products, which were suited more
 to institutions than retail.
 And the other, which is if you want to do that,
 that's fine.
 But the other was more focused on Bitcoin,
 only providing a good safe product
 for consumers every day, people,
 you can say plebs or however you want to put it,
 and trying to support them,
 helping educate them to self custody.
 And that was me.
 And so at some point we split the company in two
 and we sold off the complex derivatives product
 and that became CoinFlex down the line.
 And that left CoinFloor.
 But by that point, we already had Ethereum
 and it was still running.
 But then we decided, look, we're going to go through
 and review every coin we hold
 and objectively come up with criteria
 for which ones should we hold
 and which ones shouldn't we hold.
 We're not gonna do this in a subjective finger in the air,
 decide we're gonna test everything, including Bitcoin.
 So what are objective ways to determine
 whether you should list a coin?
 Well, one, technical maturity.
 It should be technically mature.
 It's not safe to give a customer something
 which is gonna blow up.
 Maybe you could, but I cannot see an objective reason
 why that's valid.
 Another objective reason is,
 does it have enough traction and community support?
 Because if it doesn't, then there's a risk
 it could just fizzle away overnight.
 And again, it doesn't seem reasonable
 to offer something which could disappear tomorrow,
 could be fly by night.
 And then we're regulated exchange.
 There should be regulatory clarity as well.
 And so when you take those three,
 and also the last thing is moneyness
 'cause these things are supposed to be stores of value.
 You're asking people to store value against them.
 So it shouldn't be something that by definition
 is at least attempting to be a money.
 So we went through these
 and we thought these were the only objective criteria.
 If you could add more, let me know,
 but these seem objective.
 And when you went through every single coin,
 the only one that made it,
 that just made it by the way, was Bitcoin.
 And nothing else came anywhere close
 'cause either we tried to be very, really tight.
 And Bitcoin only just makes it.
 Most things only just make it if they're in that camp
 and everything else didn't make it.
 Ethereum, for example, we finally delisted
 when they announced Ethereum 2.
 And some of the leading devs on Ethereum,
 and this was after about seven or six or seven months
 of listing on our site.
 Some of the leading devs said that
 Ethereum is not really going to make it,
 going to cut it for global growth.
 So we have to come up with Ethereum 2.
 So effectively, the creators of Ethereum
 are telling the EU that Ethereum is not good enough.
 Well, objectively, if it's not technically good enough
 from the view of the creators, it's not good enough.
 And so that was the final reason
 that I had for justifying the removal of Ethereum.
 And I never looked back.
 And they continue to do things to reduce their moneyness.
 And for example, moving to proof of stake
 is another shooting in the head, foot, knees,
 and heart at the same time move.
 And so for that reason, everything else was delisted.
 We went Bitcoin only.
 And looking at what the plans were
 for every other cryptocurrency,
 it became clear that nothing else other than Bitcoin
 will ever have a chance of meeting these requirements.
 But we had to work hard as a community
 to make sure Bitcoin doesn't fall into the trap
 of ever losing these four things,
 especially its focus on being a money,
 its focus on technical maturity and strength.
 And 'cause if you keep those two
 and maintaining the community through education and so on,
 so we tried our part as well
 on building up a strong community.
 Because if you lose that community,
 everything starts with the community.
 And if it has the wrong mindset,
 everything else follows or everything else falls.
 In terms of running an exchange and the ups and downs,
 one of the best things that we did,
 and it was a hard thing, but we managed to,
 and companies several times larger didn't,
 was to put in place provable solvency audits.
 'Cause it's a really good discipline
 basis, you attest to the fact that you're solvent.
 And that reminds-- one, that gives people
 some comfort of mind.
 But two, it reminds you of who's serving whom.
 And it leads to this culture that pervades
 everything else we do.
 And as a result, it meant that we
 made sure we knew what was happening
 with our funds regularly.
 So it was not possible for us to be insolvent.
 It made us prioritize providing simple, clean features
 for users.
 It just permeated-- just like the way being an owner
 of Bitcoin permeates your soul and affects
 your culture and mindset, having that sort of discipline
 on a monthly basis did the same thing for us.
 So by the end, by four or five years in, you start having a--
 I wouldn't say a distaste, but you
 are uncomfortable with offering users highly complex things
 that put them at risk in other ways.
 And those highly complex things are also
 the sort of things that tend to blow up during fast market
 moves and so on.
 So we would avoid that.
 We never had-- we would take great pains
 because our offering was simpler and we were only Bitcoin-only
 as well.
 We were able to focus on making sort of security
 was really good.
 So we never were hacked in our entire period.
 We never had issues with downtime
 when other exchanges would fail.
 We kept ticking.
 But more to the point, it became clear
 that many other exchanges had a misalignment of incentives.
 Their incentive was to keep people on the exchange
 as long as possible, to get them to spend money
 on speculative things as much as possible, which didn't
 feel to me that they were providing a service that
 met the needs of their customers.
 So that was one of the big reasons
 why I wanted to leave the exchange space
 and find a way of getting people off exchanges as quickly
 as possible.
 All right, well, that leads us into Fedimint, right?
 So can you talk a little bit about--
 you've been stressing for a long time
 the importance of self-custody.
 But I think-- and we sort of talked
 about this in our pre-interview call--
 that for mass adoption, some people
 don't want to have the responsibility
 or can't have the responsibility of just becoming their own bank.
 And they do want to introduce a little bit of trust.
 So can you talk a little bit about the origins of Fedimint,
 what it is, and help people understand
 the idea of these federations?
 Yeah, so most people--
 first of all, just to be clear, I
 think we're both on the same page
 that if you have the financial means--
 and hopefully that's getting lower each day,
 but the financial means--
 the technical acumen, again, hopefully
 that's getting lower each day.
 And just the guts, because we've been taught
 to not to be afraid of taking responsibility for our money.
 But if you have all those three, then you
 should definitely self-custody.
 It's the-- I would say it's the gold standard,
 the Bitcoin standard is the best you can do.
 Although it is important to be aware that most people do not
 self-custody safely, because your 24-word seed is also
 your wallet.
 And if you're storing it in a bank,
 then you're not got first-party custody,
 because you've just given it to a regulated third party,
 for example.
 Or if you're giving it to friends, again,
 then that's second-party custody.
 But if you can do first-party custody correctly,
 then it's great.
 However, for most people, they have two choices,
 because that's really 5%, maybe 10% of the world
 can get to that.
 And when you're thinking globally, 90% to 95% can't.
 And they're in two buckets.
 You've got some of the poorest people
 in the world who literally can't even get an account on an
 exchange.
 One, because they're regulated exchanges,
 they may not be able to give them accounts.
 And two, even if they're able to give them accounts,
 they're commercial institutions.
 And therefore, there needs to be a certain amount of revenue
 they can make to justify that person being a customer.
 And for billions of people on the planet,
 they just won't make enough--
 they won't represent enough revenue
 to be worthwhile as a customer.
 So they're excluded, because they're just not
 profitable enough.
 So there's billions who literally cannot get into
 Bitcoin for cost reasons, effectively, worldwide.
 And then there are a whole set of people
 who have money on a regulated exchange.
 And as I said, there are a few well-run regulated exchanges.
 But there are many, many, as we've seen, unfortunately,
 recently, where I would not feel comfortable recommending
 any one hold.
 And having a viable option to not be on an exchange
 is something that we need to have.
 So along comes FEDI and FEDIMINT.
 FEDIMINT is a different paradigm for custody,
 whereas you have first-party custody, where you're--
 I would call it do-it-yourself custody.
 You do it all yourself.
 You figure it all out with education and so on,
 versus third-party regulated custody,
 which is another way of putting it-- stranger custody,
 where you're giving your money to a stranger who's
 incentivized to earn money, and you're giving them your money.
 And the risk is, like in some recent cases,
 people might do something like steal your money
 or gamble with your money and take--
 and so on and so forth in their quest to earn money,
 as opposed to doing what they're supposed to do,
 which is just look after your money.
 So then you have this middle ground, just community custody,
 where it's-- think of it as the idea where
 first-party custody is not your keys, not your coins.
 This is not our keys, not our coins.
 So the community is coming together
 to elect some of the most trusted elements
 of their community to custody the Bitcoin
 on behalf of the community.
 And that is the high-level idea behind FEDIMINT.
 So talk to me a little bit about the process of starting
 something like this and really gaining the customer
 base and the awareness, because I think for so many people,
 even if they were introduced to Bitcoin,
 especially in the last two years since the pandemic,
 I think that was kind of an explosion of education
 because of the value proposition with all the money printing
 and the number go up.
 But really, in terms of educating people on custody
 and on the risks and fallbacks of some of these exchanges,
 how do you build a company like this?
 Yeah, that's a very interesting question.
 I think that's probably--
 we have quite a--
 I like to think we have a quite unique approach.
 There are some other companies in the space that
 are doing similar things, and we're learning from them.
 But we're really focusing on this.
 And I think it's the reason why we raised our round so quickly
 in, I think, six days or something over a bank holiday
 weekend.
 So I would split it into three chunks, where
 we focus one third, one third, one third.
 So coding, coaching, collaboration.
 So on the coding side, it's FedE Mint.
 It's this open source protocol that we're supporting.
 And many others are supporting as well, not just us.
 Blockstream and Spiral, so Blockfree Spiral,
 and many others.
 We're talking to Bitcoin miners and so on,
 who also want to support that.
 And then FedE, which is going to be this incredibly simple
 lightning wallet, which works directly and interfaces
 directly with FedE Mint and Federation,
 so you can just use it seamlessly.
 So that's the coding side.
 But that's just one third of the business.
 One third is on coaching.
 So we plan to create almost this network of guardians,
 or the guardians are the people who
 are responsible for looking after a given Federation's
 Bitcoin around the world.
 And we'll provide this support network of FedE Knights,
 as it were, who effectively are there
 on the ground in local countries to educate, run workshops,
 answer questions locally.
 And obviously, there'll be a hierarchy above them.
 Some of the best might become considered FedE masters,
 as it were, who can support these regions of the world.
 So think about certain large organizations,
 like Avon or Amway or so on, who have
 these very large structures of educational structures, which
 can support people around globally
 in multiple languages.
 But that's the organization that can be relatively small.
 We want to be able to do that, because that's
 really important.
 We believe that it's not just about the artificial
 intelligence of the software, but we also
 need to upgrade the human intelligence of the users.
 Because no matter what the software is,
 sometimes we try to come up with these overly technical solutions
 to dealing with concerns or issues,
 when the best solution is just to educate people
 to protect themselves from scams,
 to make sure they manage their money correctly.
 Maybe they should monitor the Federation
 if the balances are too much on a given Federation.
 Split your funds across multiple federations is good.
 Maybe you shouldn't have all your money in one place.
 All these are sound money management things,
 which anybody should learn.
 But we're going to educate people
 about that and about Bitcoin.
 Also, if your personal balances on a FedEmin Federation
 are above a certain size, then hey,
 maybe you're now at a level where
 you should self-custody, because you
 have enough to make sense.
 And that's-- our objective is to turn people
 into better Bitcoiners all the way through.
 And the final thing is collaboration.
 It's not about all FedE, but we're going to partner.
 There are some incredible companies out there.
 You've got BitRefill doing incredible things,
 Paxful, Zebedee, FountainFM, Stackwork,
 where people can earn $2, $3 an hour
 and immediately generate money and increase the--
 and in the global South, that's a ton of money.
 And the list goes on.
 And instead of trying to compete with these,
 we will partner and collaborate with them
 and educate our users about them so they
 know that they can custody and immediately say, well,
 now we're going to show you how you can start earning money now
 that you've custodied immediately.
 And we're also going to show you how
 you can convert it into the local currency
 using this other service so that you
 can have it in your pocket.
 So we give them an all-around education
 to solve actual problems they have,
 as opposed to give them Bitcoin or give them a wallet.
 We're going to give them a way to remit at a lower cost,
 cutting out Western Union, or to earn money
 and to better their life with their family and friends.
 Wow.
 That's incredible.
 So just from a practical standpoint,
 I have a certain amount of Satoshis.
 I give them to you or to this federation.
 How does that work?
 Who has-- it's multi-sig, right, still?
 It's multiple keys?
 Yeah, so first of all, you don't give it to us.
 We're building software.
 And we're making that software available as open source.
 But a group can take that software.
 Let's say that I was contacted by a group of people
 who represent a village in South Africa the other day,
 for example.
 And they've already tried--
 they're trying to set up something
 like a Bitcoin beach-like idea, but in South Africa.
 And their challenge is that the current systems,
 alternatives are just too technical for them.
 And FedEmints are designed to be really, really simple
 to set up.
 So as long as you are someone who
 cares about your community, that's
 your only qualification to be able to be a FedEmint guardian.
 And being able to turn on a computer and click run,
 that's pretty much it.
 That's where we're aiming for.
 So they've seen this, and they want to set it up.
 And they're perfect.
 Group of people to be guardians, they've
 got a track record of prioritizing social capital
 over financial capital.
 So they download the FedEmint software.
 It will be available eventually on Umbrell, on Noddle,
 on Start9, on RaspiBless as well.
 So really easy just to click.
 It's really easy just to click.
 and get going. Let's say five of them form a federation or other guardians of a federation.
 They all download the software, they put in the addresses of all the other five,
 and then the FedEmint software locates the other five and forms a federation automatically.
 They just sit back, have a cup of coffee, a cup of chai, whatever it is, or tea in my case,
 and when they come back, Bitcoin knows of synced and a federation set up, and they will all see
 a QR code, which is effectively the address of the federation. They now can download a FedEmint
 aware wallet. To begin with, it will only be FedE, but we really hope other people create
 FedEmint aware wallets. You download FedE, for example, and you scan the QR code, and that's it,
 you have joined the federation. There's no passports, there's no date of birth, that's it,
 and also no 24-word backup. You've just done it. That's the whole process. Scan the QR code,
 and you're there. So now anybody who joins is part of that federation. Those five guardians
 are together managing any Bitcoin sent to or from that federation. You need a majority of
 them to work together. So if one of them, or even two of them, for some reason, went from a lifedime
 of being honest and helpful to the community to switch, it wouldn't be enough because you need
 a majority of them to all of a sudden turn to Mr. Hyde from Dr. Jackal overnight.
 Well, so forgive me for some of the... I'm much less technical. So how can you,
 within the federation, how do you know what coins belong to who?
 I mean, how does the custody aspect actually work?
 Well, for someone non-technical, that was a very, very super interesting question,
 and that's one of the things. There are no accounts in... Because normally with other exchanges,
 and this is exciting to cryptographers, actually, and this is where,
 you might have heard it, it uses this concept called "Chowmium Mints,"
 and it's this privacy-preserving protocol. And that's the way you can identify who owns what
 without actually having accounts for Natalie, Obi, and Eric, et cetera. So the analogy is,
 instead of saying, "Here's your account, and this is the balance in your account,"
 you would say, "I'm the bank," just taking this privacy protocol, ignoring the federation-type
 stuff to begin with. "I'm a bank, and I've got a kiosk window, a cashier's desk. Behind me is the
 safe, and I can also write you IOUs. I've got a notepad, and I can just write IOU $10, $5, $1."
 So you give me, I don't know, $20 notes, and I give you a note saying $5, $5, and then I give
 you $10, $1 notes that say $1, and I give them to you. You can now take those. As long as you
 and other parties trust those notes, you can use them to replace that $20. It's like an IOU for
 the money. And at a later stage, you can come back, give me some of the remaining IOUs that
 you haven't spent or the ones you've acquired, and I can check, and it's got my handwriting and my
 signature at the bottom. I can accept them from you, and I can destroy them. I shred them, and I
 give you the equivalent amount in cash because I knew that I was the one who wrote it.
 Isn't that the way banks, in theory, should work, but instead we have fractional reserve banking
 where they're giving out the IOUs without having the reserves?
 Exactly. That's how it should work. And by the way, it is possible, by the way, for the person
 giving out the IOUs to actually give out IOUs for money it doesn't have. That's possible. That's a
 risk if there's one person, by the way, and we'll come on to that. So what in 1983, David Chalm,
 and he's one of the people that Satoshi referenced in the white paper, came up with this form of
 cryptography, and it's very simple cryptography called blinded signatures, and it's nearly 40
 years old. Next year it's going to be 40 years old. So it's very, very mature, battle-tested,
 and relatively simple. It's not trying to do this fancy zero-knowledge proof stuff. It's very
 simple. And what it allows you to do is effectively sign something without knowing what it is that
 you sign. So you can sign but blindly, you know, effectively, hence the name. And what that can do
 in the context of this minting scenario, this cashier scenario, is it's effectively the same as
 you painting over the screen with black paint so that you don't know who you're dealing with.
 So then someone can give in some cash, you don't know who it is because it's blind,
 and then you return and sign back a token for that person and they can go off and spend it.
 Now, they can spend it, they can give it to someone else, they can do whatever they want,
 and then they can return it back to you, or someone else can return it back to you.
 Now, just the simple addition of the blinding of the cashier window means that you now have
 perfect privacy because you have no idea who's giving you the money, you have no idea who's
 returning it to you. And you don't have any accounts for people, it's just money in and
 money out. But people know how much they have, and they have the notes. So they don't need you
 to know how much each person has, they just need to give you the IOUs act like a bearer instrument,
 as long as you trust them. Now, the downside is you go up into it was invented in 1983.
 But it had two problems. One, it the money that you put in in the first place was cash. And cash
 is, you know, cash can only be owned by one person at a time. You cannot have multiple people
 owning the same pound note or dollar note until 2009, when Bitcoin is invented, because with
 multi-sig, multiple people can now own the same amount of money. And the other the other problem
 was, there's one bank and that one bank, you could become dishonest until Liquid and Bitcoin and
 Blockstream invented this or invented but popularized this idea called federations. And
 that allows you to take one process that normally one person performs and split it up amongst
 multiple people. And it can only progress if a majority of them perform a task. And that was the
 missing piece. After that, a number of cryptographers came together in hackers Congress
 in Prague, a few years ago and thought, well, we can take this amazing idea for cryptography
 called Xiaomi and Mint that's been around for 40 years. Combine it with Bitcoin for the money
 instead of say the US dollar for the money, because the first money that multiple people can own,
 and then use federations. So instead of one cashier, you had multiple cashiers working in
 concerts. So even if one becomes dishonest, the others can keep them honest. And we could
 effectively create this federated Xiaomi and Mint, i.e. FediMint. FediMint is the mashup of that.
 And so we decentralized this incredible privacy tech. And that's where it started. And that's
 that was the base. That's the base technology for the first time that we've created.
 Wow, that is fascinating. I can really understand why you had such an easy time getting investors,
 including Jeff Booth's company, right? EgoDeath Capital and some of these other great investors.
 So just to start to wrap up here, in terms of what you mentioned about getting Bitcoin into
 the hands of billions who still don't have access to it, can you kind of crystallize how Fedi helps
 with that? So FediMint is this base protocol that provides incredible privacy for the community of
 users that are using it. And it's a very, very simple system to set up and run, etc. But it is
 like Bitcoin, the core protocol, the Lightning core protocol is supposed to be running on a machine in
 the background, just sitting there like a set-top box, you forget about it. But that's not the user
 interface that people use. And so the Fedi app is designed to be like a Lightning wallet is for
 Lightning network or a Bitcoin wallet for the Bitcoin network. It provides this user-friendly,
 really, really simple interface for using that. But it's so much more than that, because it also
 provides us a say with through collaboration, it provides a window into the Bitcoin ecosystem,
 showing people in a very easy, highly integrated format, a number of the services that are
 available, and they're already there, but people don't necessarily know about. So if we integrate
 it into the app, people can with a click of a button be using any one of these other services
 and gaining benefit from that. And then finally, Fedi is the organization, isn't just the app,
 but it's this whole approach to education. So we can make the app really easy to use, which we will,
 we can bake in education into the app. And we can bake in these collaborations. But we believe that
 for systems like this to really gain mass adoption and get to the point of hyper-baconization,
 we have to educate people on the ground, in person, on how to use this at massive scale.
 And that's the other part of what we do. Well, to go back to something we mentioned earlier,
 Web3 being that buzzword, and people really do, they get behind it thinking that this is going to
 create that decentralized future of, say, social media and take back some of the power. What do
 you want people to know? What is your take on this movement and all these people saying,
 "I want to help create Web3"? So, I mean, unfortunately, Web3 has sort of been hijacked
 as a term. But I think the desire to take power away from highly centralized internet companies
 and bring it back into the hands of users is laudable, and we should try to do that.
 And we're trying to do it with Fedi giving communities back the power to be their own bank,
 as it were. But the funny thing is, we're going to see, and which is why I'm very convinced that
 Bitcoin wins in 2023, we're going to see a number of companies in the Bitcoin space
 come out with incredible technologies, not just Fedi, which will actually allow people to do this
 but to do it properly, not in this rushed first to market, but ill thought out, ill considered
 non scalable way, but in highly scalable, easy to use, incredibly powerful, privacy preserving ways.
 It's just a matter of crazy happenstance that they're all coming out in around the same time.
 But I'm incredibly excited about it. And Bitcoin is the base layer, with Lightning as the second
 layer, you're going to see this plethora of really interesting third layer solutions,
 and Fedi and FediMint are just one of them. Do you still go back to Nigeria? And can you
 offer any perspective in terms of adoption of Bitcoin there? Because I understand that it's
 one of the countries where a Bitcoin is most needed, but also adoption is growing faster
 than in other places. Yeah, so I go back to I travel around the global south a lot.
 In Africa, I go to Nigeria now and again, the last time was a year ago. But this year,
 I'll be going to Ghana for Afro Bitcoin 2022. And I'll also be going to Kenya for a set of
 workshops and maybe others to be decided. But in terms of adoption, but I also have a lot of
 friends and family in Nigeria. And yes, the adoption levels are crazy. Outside of the sort of
 the bubble of the West, the really exciting things are happening in the global south.
 And it's also bottom up, there isn't necessarily this
 structured process to try and force it happening. I was talking
 to the guys from Paxful and they're one of the organizations that does quite a lot to
 try and educate people on the ground in these different areas.
 And whereas in Latin America they put in a lot of effort to grow, they then came to West
 Africa and they said it was all organic.
 They just came there and it just exploded itself.
 You have to understand almost every Nigerian from about three years old is a businessman
 or woman.
 They're hustling.
 So when they see an opportunity to earn money or to improve their life or so on, they'll
 naturally think about how they can turn it into a business.
 They're the ultimate sort of capitalists.
 And so it's no wonder that the level of adoption is growing exponentially.
 You've talked about on both this show and other interviews that I saw just this idea
 of you want to be part of a change in terms of righting some of the injustice that exists.
 Can you talk a little bit about how Bitcoin actually addresses that?
 Well, as I said, Bitcoin is the world's first meritocratic money.
 And I want to be clear, I don't think it logically can get to a point where everybody has exactly
 the same equal outcome.
 And I don't even think that's necessarily desirable.
 But I do think that you want to...
 Structural roadblocks that prevent people from just being able to achieve their best
 are just not good for the person and they're not good for the world.
 And one of the biggest structural roadblocks is money, especially the challenge of being
 far away from the money spigot is a big injustice.
 And that's globally.
 And for many years, Western Europe was sort of protected to some degree from that.
 But now, even in that case, it's like we're seeing the euro falling underneath the value
 of the US dollar.
 And if things continue like this, the British pound will soon follow because the US is becoming
 more insular and focused on making sure it's protecting itself, not just itself, not itself
 and allies anymore.
 So they're starting to see the effect that the rest of the world who weren't so close
 to the money spigot have experienced for the last 50 plus years.
 Just after I was born, not just after a few years, because I could remember it, I can't
 remember when I was like one year old, but three or four years old, I remember that one,
 I still remember to say one naira was worth more than one US dollar.
 Now one US dollar is worth five, 600 naira.
 That's in a period of a few decades.
 And this is when you're far away from the money spigot, because you're in a developing
 country.
 And on a global level is incredibly unfair.
 And this way you solve that is to have the world reserve currency separated from any
 country that you don't want to have this tripping dilemma where for one country where it owns
 the world reserve currency, and it has to deal with its own local, its own national
 economic and financial considerations.
 You separate the two and you go back to having a money, which has been the norm on the gold
 standard for many, many, many decades and centuries that is not owned by anyone.
 But fit the purpose of modern times.
 And that's what Bitcoin is.
 The repercussions of that will take many decades to play out.
 But I think if I can help towards that making happen, I will absolutely do everything I
 can.
 Well, you mentioned 2023 starts the time when Bitcoin wins.
 So how confident are you that Bitcoin will succeed and will be able to overcome the obstacles
 of say countries coming out against it or trying to ban it or trying to ban mining?
 I mean, are you like all in on Bitcoin or are you still, you know, it's a portion of
 your portfolio and yet you recognize some major risks in the long term?
 I am, I don't call myself a Bitcoin maximalist, I call myself a Bitcoin rationalist.
 So I am rationally all in on Bitcoin because if it just logically when I go through, I
 cannot see any other, including fiat that I'd want to hold in any significant quantity.
 So I am fiat poor, definitely.
 I maintain the minimum amount I need to maintain to just cover my costs.
 I do have a salary, so that allows me to support that.
 But anything that's spare is dollar cost averaged into Bitcoin.
 Now that I think speaks, speaks loudly towards my conviction that Bitcoin can deal with just
 from a rational point of view, all of the concerns or risks that people may have.
 There are two areas that concern me for a while.
 One and these are two questions that keep being thrown at Bitcoin.
 One is that Bitcoin mining wastes energy.
 And the other one is that Bitcoin is not useful for anything other than gambling and selling
 drugs or so on.
 Both of them, I believe, and many people in the space and industry believe are incorrect.
 And we've believed that for a while.
 But I did believe that many laymen and laywomen didn't understand this.
 But a number of initiatives that are happening right now are set to debunk those and prove
 those to be wrong.
 And I'm fortunate enough to be part of two.
 So on one hand, on the Bitcoin doesn't have value.
 Well, this is the biggest question.
 Because if you and when you show that Bitcoin does have value beyond these two things, categorically,
 then you actually resolve many other issues or questions.
 FedE does that.
 By the end of next year, we aim to have one, two or three places that are hyper Bitcoinized.
 And the way we define hyper Bitcoinization is just to have a measuring stick is 51% of
 the people in a given city or country or region using Bitcoin every day.
 And that's not holding it or trading it, but using it to buy, sell and so on.
 That's our stretch goal.
 Our main milestone is super Bitcoinization, which we define 21% using it every week within
 a given region, which will still be pretty good.
 But our stretch goal is 51%.
 The way I like to think about it is we 51% attacked that city or that country effectively.
 So we will make that happen.
 And we will make it happen in the next 18 months.
 At that point, and because we're focusing on the global south, where you're taking people
 from zero to one, or maybe from one to two, that's in the global, although everybody can
 use it anywhere in the global north, you're going from 100 to 101.
 It has far more of an impact.
 And therefore, when we combine that with our visits across the EU parliaments and Washington,
 DC, which we also plan to do throughout next year, we will just point instead of trying
 to explain it, we'll say here's a ticket.
 There's a country go there.
 Bitcoin is beautiful.
 El Salvador is beautiful.
 Wherever it is, we do this.
 And just see it for yourself.
 Don't discuss it for yourself.
 We won't, you can talk to anybody you want, and then come back and understand that Bitcoin
 is value.
 And on the other side, Bitcoin waste energy.
 I have recently completed the investment in a Bitcoin mining company in East Africa, which
 is specifically I wanted to invest in a company using 100% renewables using hydro.
 But as well as that, it's using the renewables in rural East Africa to help electrify rural
 East Africa by helping dozens of aspiring energy entrepreneurs who are making these
 energy production plants that the national grid is no interest in servicing because in
 the middle of, you know, the middle of rural Africa.
 But they're allowing to electrify villages and townships and so on.
 They can normally not get loans for this because it's a very risky investment.
 Banks want to invest, but they have no way to know whether these organizations will actually
 the villagers will actually pay back the money because of the quantity, leaving them to continue
 to light their houses and heat their homes using paraffin and kerosene, which are incredibly
 noxious and by the way, bad for the environment.
 It's clean hydro based electricity.
 So along comes a Bitcoin mining organization that we're investing in called Gridless.
 And what they do is they act like an anchor tenant for these mining companies in the same
 way if you go into small town America or small town Europe and a shopping mall wants to set
 up to bring new, to revitalize a town.
 They have an anchor tenant like a UCI cinemas or a Walmart or so on.
 And that effectively guarantees that they can fund 30, 40% of their costs and that allows
 a bank to lend them and to take the risk on the other 30, 50, 60%.
 Because we have some of the best Bitcoin miners in the world, friends of mine from Texas who
 have been mining since 2010, who are going to work with these guys to make sure they
 operate to the best possible standard.
 They're coming in from Texas, yee-haw, we're going to build some mining rigs over here.
 They're coming over and they're going to make sure that these operations are operated to
 the highest level because Bitcoin is trying to make sure we're not trying to just make
 money, we're trying to make Bitcoin into money here.
 And so they're going to work with us, make sure we operate to the highest levels of governance
 with the highest social impact using 100% renewable energy.
 So I'd really like to see the ESG arguments against that.
 And then we will show that Bitcoin is useful and it doesn't waste energy and it actually
 spends, it pays for energy wherever that energy is, even if it's in the middle of the jungle
 where no one else is willing to pay for it.
 Wow, that is amazing.
 It's just, it's so awesome to talk to you.
 I'm getting more and more bullish.
 Sometimes it gets a little bit hard in this bear market to keep up the spirits, but thank
 you so, so much, Obi.
 Anything you want to leave the viewers, the listeners with, especially during this time
 where on a macroeconomic level, things are so volatile, so choppy, we're basically waiting
 on bated breath for what a couple people, central bankers are going to say and do.
 What do you want to leave people with?
 I think that focus on building, focus on building and focus on building.
 That's what you should do.
 I am incredibly bullish for Bitcoin.
 It's times like this that Bitcoin really shows what it is.
 It's the lowest thing, but it's the most powerful thing.
 It's this cockroach currency, mold money.
 It can deal with the most difficult situation, but it keeps on ticking and keeps on growing
 and it can survive everything and it will change the world.
 Wow, I don't think I've ever heard that, cockroach money.
 I love that.
 Obi, thank you so much.
 No worries.
 Thank you.
