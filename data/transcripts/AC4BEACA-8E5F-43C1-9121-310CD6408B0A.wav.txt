 Preston Pysh (00:00:30):
 Hey, everyone.
 Welcome to this week's episode of the Bitcoin Fundamentals Podcast.
 On today's show, I have a titan in the Bitcoin space with Obi Nwosu.
 Obi is one of the leading experts and builders on the custody protocol called Fediment.
 During our discussion, we cover what the protocol is, why it's so exciting and important for
 future growth and building, how Obi became a nonprofit board member on BTrust with Jay-Z
 and Jack Dorsey, the lessons he learned from founding, owning, operating, and selling a
 large exchange among many other fascinating topics.
 This isn't one you'll want to miss, so get ready for my chat with Obi Nwosu.
 You're listening to Bitcoin Fundamentals by The Investors Podcast Network.
 Now for your host, Preston Pysh.
 Preston Pysh (00:01:15):
 Hey everyone.
 Welcome to the show.
 Like I said in the introduction, I'm here with Obi, and I'm really excited to do this
 conversation.
 It took a little bit of preparation on my part to get myself smart enough to have this
 conversation with you.
 So I'm really excited to have you on the show.
 Obi Nwosu (00:01:34):
 Okay.
 I think I needed to probably do the same level of preparation, and I haven't for my sins.
 So you're probably going to outsmart me on 30 minutes.
 Preston Pysh (00:01:42):
 No, no, sir.
 Hey, so tell us your Bitcoin story, because you've been in this space for a very long
 time, a very, very long time.
 How did you find this?
 How did you find Bitcoin originally?
 Obi Nwosu (00:01:56):
 Originally, well, by background, a geek.
 I studied computer science and cognitive science in University College London.
 And so I was trying to make our new robot overlords, and it seems like they've been
 doing fine without me.
 And then I went into the tech industry in the European space.
 I was involved with massively multiplayer role-playing games, 30 million users, all
 this sort of stuff.
 Preston Pysh (00:02:22):
 Wow.
 Obi Nwosu (00:02:22):
 Yeah.
 And as a background, I was always interested in just the disparities in the world.
 My family was from Nigeria.
 I could see the difference between the global South and the global and the Western world.
 And I was really into technology.
 So when some friends of mine heard about Bitcoin in 2011, they just thought this is going to
 be right up Obi's street.
 And they informed me about it.
 And lo and behold, I found it very interesting.
 I looked at it intensely for about three months, but I was running my own business at the time.
 So other than buying a very small amount, I found the technology very interesting, but
 I didn't just sort of dive in because I was focused on life.
 And then two years later, well, the price crashed actually, from my perspective.
 I think it went from $100 down to like $20.
 And I thought, "Okay, the technology is great, but I have concerns in the long-term viability."
 So I focused on my business.
 Three years later, a company I had angel invested in, the founder approached me again.
 The company didn't succeed, but I thought the founders were really clever guys.
 And they said, "Look, while running this other business, we came across," because it was
 a sort of voucher token reward system, "they came across this thing called Bitcoin."
 And I thought, "Well, that's still around."
 I checked it again, 2013.
 And lo and behold, it was now a few hundred.
 And so I thought, "Okay, this is great technology.
 The mission is great."
 Making meritocratic money, is the way I would put it.
 And it had staying power.
 And there was a clear problem that the exchanges around at the time were...
 Mt. Gox was in the middle of failing, and they weren't trusted.
 So the simple idea of making a trusted exchange in the UK where we're focused came about.
 And so I decided to, with my co-founders, co-found Coinflop, which was the UK's, at
 that time, a young exchange.
 But eight years later, we sold it.
 It was the longest running Bitcoin-only exchange in the UK.
 And yeah, that was the story.
 I started off as a CTO.
 Within nine months, I was the CTO and CEO of Coinflop.
 And we had multiple ups and downs, but ultimately more ups than downs.
 And I sold it at the end of last year.
 So that was my-
 Preston Pysh (00:15:40): That's unreal.
 This is unreal.
 And I can't believe you're regulatory, trying to do this back when it had never been done.
 I mean, like you said, it was Mt. Gox over in Japan, and that was basically it.
 And it was very boutique.
 And you're probably looking at trying to do this in the UK.
 I just couldn't imagine the regulatory burden that you were dealing with.
 Roy Bhandari (00:16:12): I've been in the Bitcoin space for eight
 years, and that's about 80 years of regulatory experience.
 When we started, we applied.
 In fact, before we started, we applied to the FSA at the time.
 Now it's the FCA.
 And I believe FSA was the Financial Standards Authority.
 I can't remember.
 It changed.
 Now it's the Financial Conduct Authority.
 And we said, "Look, we're staying in this company.
 We want to be regulated, and here's what we're doing."
 And they came back very politely saying, "Thank you very much, but what we believe you're
 doing is not a regulated activity.
 So go ahead and do it, but we're not going to regulate you."
 And so with that letter, we started.
 But that was where we began.
 But we still wanted to be incredibly transparent.
 There was a Bitcoin core engineer who suggested this idea called provable solvency or proof
 of proof of reserves.
 And we decided to implement that.
 I think a number of exchanges, Kraken, Coinbase, blockchain.info at the time, now it's blockchain.com,
 BTC China, now it's defunct.
 And I think this stamp as well, they all also made public statements that they would also
 implement proof of reserves.
 Unfortunately, we're the only ones who actually did it.
 I think Kraken did one and stopped.
 All of them removed the public statements off their websites after six months.
 But you can go back in the way back when machine and find the original promise to do this.
 You can leave it for the readers or the listeners to determine why they decided not to do proof
 of reserves.
 But we did it every month for eight years.
 And this is something I think Nick Carter talked about continuously.
 And yeah, many other things.
 We in the Bitcoin cash wars, we were one of the few exchanges to be not a fan of this
 sort of SegWit2x sort of compromise.
 We said, look, whatever they use to be Bitcoin, is Bitcoin.
 We educated everyone ranging from the intelligence services to the police to politicians.
 I gave evidence in front of the UK Parliament's Treasury Select Committee, which is a bit
 like the Senate Committee hearings.
 We did everything to try and educate people and educate the regulators.
 We started on a position when it took us talking to nearly 200 banks across Europe to get a
 bank account at that time.
 Now for this new project we're working on, I've talked to four banks and four banks listen
 to me and are interested in opening bank accounts.
 It's still tough.
 You still have to fill in 70 page forms.
 But it's much better than when I had to travel to Estonia to become an Estonian e-citizen
 just to get a bank account or travel to Poland or travel around Europe.
 So I've seen a lot when it comes to regulation.
 So your impetus for starting the exchange and doing this was custody related, correct?
 Yes.
 Well, the impetus was to solve the problem of helping people go from fiat to Bitcoin.
 We saw ourselves as this Robin Hood like, I saw myself as Robin Hood like character,
 sort of rescuing people from this world of this regulated inflationary money.
 And allowing them to move over to this regulation free, inflation free money.
 And as part of that, you had to provide them a custody solution that was safe and reliable,
 etc.
 And so we decided that we wanted to be as transparent as possible because we're holding
 people's money on their behalf.
 And also to bring back trust, especially in the wake of Mt. Gox, we felt that we would
 go down this road to regulation.
 And that was the way to do it.
 Because at the end of the day, we're a third party.
 We are effectively a stranger to our customer.
 And we're incentivized to earn money.
 And you're asking us to look after your money.
 So there is a perverse incentive there, where in most cases, it's incentivized to make money
 that leads to competition, innovation, and so on.
 Because to earn money, you have to provide an incredibly, the most efficient way to earn
 money is providing incredibly good service to your customers.
 But in the case where you're custodying money, then the most efficient way to earn money
 can be just to take the money.
 And especially some entrepreneurs who walk the line might start, as we've seen recently,
 start doing things like gambling with your money, or they might abscond with your money,
 or it might just disappear, et cetera.
 And so we felt that the way to bring that trust back is to go for regulation.
 Little did I know that actually that was led you from one problem into another.
 But I discovered that over the next 10 years.
 Preston Pysh (00:15:40): So I'm assuming you had no experience with
 exchanges before going into this.
 And you hear these people who build something really large and substantial, like what you
 did with Coinfloor.
 And they'll jokingly say, "If I only knew what I know now, I would have never taken
 the first step because it was like climbing Mount Everest or some type of massive, massive
 undertaking that you just don't know."
 So your lack of knowledge or understanding of how hard the problem is would have prevented
 you from starting.
 Do you have a little bit of that sense when you look back at those eight years of running
 such a huge-
 Roy Bhandari (00:16:17): I mean, I've had ups and downs.
 So anybody who hasn't started for eight years, and there were many, many, many times that
 I wished I'd had to start the business.
 It was eight years, but I probably lost 20 years of my life expectancy.
 I've had some of the worst health days in my life, some of the most stressful periods.
 Now that I've gone through it, and because of what I've learned from it, I'm grateful
 for it because it's prepared me for what I'm doing now, which I cannot describe how happy
 and excited and passionate I am about what I'm doing now.
 And if I didn't have those skills applied to this, then it wouldn't have been the same
 thing.
 But yeah, I didn't have any experience of running an exchange at the time.
 We were very naive.
 Eight years is a long time now.
 So I've got not only experience running an exchange, but running a Bitcoin exchange and
 a regulated Bitcoin exchange.
 We were the first exchange to be regulated in Gibraltar, one of the first jurisdictions
 to provide regulation in Europe.
 We were one of the earliest in Europe and many different things.
 And in fact, actually not coming from the traditional markets was a boon for us because
 a lot of people who run exchanges come from the market where they were traders themselves.
 And it's always, we found with certain customers, there's always a slight concern when the person
 running the exchange has the same mindset as the traders.
 There's always a worry, are they trading against you?
 Are they doing all these different things?
 Whereas with us, my background was that of a technologist.
 So I just wanted to make the system work as well as possible.
 I'm not a good trader.
 So we have no interest in doing anything other than making sure the systems work incredibly
 reliably.
 We were never hacked.
 We never had these issues which seemed to plague exchanges orders of magnitude larger
 than us.
 We were a medium-sized exchange.
 We were a good-sized exchange, but exchanges that were much larger than us, when there
 were these massive moves in the markets and people really needed to trade, they all seemed
 to just go down.
 I know exactly which exchange you're talking about.
 I won't name names, but they would always seem to go down.
 But we would keep on ticking and people liked that.
 Even they knew that.
 We just made sure we kept people happy.
 We made sure we were reliable.
 We're very conservative.
 So philosophically, we were always aligned to the ideals of Bitcoin.
 So it was TikTok next block.
 And it was also the same for our exchange.
 And that's, I think, because we were first and foremost engineers and second commercially
 minded traders.
 In fact, we were zero in that regard.
 Preston Pysh (00:40:40): Yeah.
 I love that.
 I love that background, which led to the success of the performance, which is really what you're
 trying to get at with the customer, providing the customer a service.
 Now when you're looking back at that experience, if you were going to explain to your kids,
 "All right, these are the two big things I learned from those eight years that felt like
 80 years," how would you summarize your two big takeaways of what that was all about?
 Roy Bhandari (00:41:13): I have immediate thoughts to buy in, but let
 me stay out of it.
 No, let me just not.
 No, I think there's two things.
 One, you have to realize that you need to avoid regulation if you can.
 Even though we got it, I think that the innovation for Bitcoin is to be able to be regulation
 proof.
 So I'm using all that learnings to build systems, which I just don't need to be in.
 If you really want to do something of global impact for what we're doing, you want to build
 systems that are cognizant of how the world works, but don't wait for the world to catch
 up for you because that just doesn't.
 So that's the first learning.
 And the second is to be very, very, very careful of who you partner with and whether it's partnering
 organizations or people within your organization or so on and so forth.
 So that would be the second thing, I think, or who invests in you, all of this sort of
 stuff.
 If I look back, although everybody had their own perspective, and I don't wish anybody
 any ill will, I do think that there was a lot of differences of perspective in all those
 regards in terms of the direction of the organization, and that caused us a lot of challenges.
 I was very focused on going a Bitcoin-only road.
 Some people came around to that, but it took several years.
 Some people never came around to that.
 And then it led us to just like a fork in Bitcoin, that led to a fork in CoinFlow, where
 we eventually split ways and recreated the world's first physically-divided futures exchange,
 Bitcoin futures exchange.
 But that was eventually...
 There was a schism and that was sold off.
 We retained a small equity stake, which we eventually sold last year, but that became
 CoinFlex, which you now see in the news.
 And they went their own way, which was very much a Bitcoin Cash, multi-crypto, 200X leverage
 approach.
 And we went to the Bitcoin-only spot, focus for retail, dollar-cost averaging approach,
 which was closer to my philosophical view.
 But these things by themselves, and you focus on them, are different business models.
 And it doesn't really matter what you think of each one.
 There is a way where they can flourish.
 But when you have two philosophies on where to go with the business, and they're so different,
 you end up in this sort of no man's land.
 So in the end, it was actually a really good decision for us to split in two, and everybody
 could then go the direction that they wanted to go in, and they could have the future that
 they were destined to have.
 Let's take a quick break and hear from today's sponsors.
 So in the last few months, we've seen the importance of choosing a Bitcoin partner you
 can actually rely on.
 That's why people are looking towards River as their Bitcoin exchange of choice.
 In addition to letting you securely buy Bitcoin with zero fees on recurring orders, River
 has built their own infrastructure from the ground up.
 This means they don't rely on third parties.
 And because River is a company created by Bitcoiners, they actually encourage cold storage,
 which they make seamless through their auto withdrawal feature.
 However, you have peace of mind knowing Bitcoin on River is held one to one in multi-sig cold
 storage in addition to being fully licensed and regulated in the US.
 River also offers a hosted mining service to mine Bitcoin hassle free at one of their
 facilities.
 And they also have a lightning API for developers looking to run lightning network payments
 without managing the entire infrastructure stack themselves.
 Plus, River has a relationship management and client service team that's US based and
 available by phone for you and your business.
 There's a new standard in Bitcoin and River is setting it.
 See why at River.com.

 Preston Pysh (00:05:40): Fascinating.
 I love those two points.
 Avoid regulation if you can, and be careful with who you partner with.
 I think with the three arrows capital situation, boy, that last point really hits home for
 a lot of people these days of who they're partnering with or who they're working with,
 and such a salient point across all time.
 When people are…
 This is, I think, a question that I get a lot when I'm just talking to anybody about
 Bitcoin in particular.
 People are always asking which exchange to use.
 Do you have any tips for people as they're looking at selecting an exchange?
 What are some rule of thumbs or something that's really simple for them to do a little
 bit of an analysis on who to select as they're trusting?
 Because what we're about to talk about gets into the future of trust and custody and all
 that kind of stuff.
 But for people today, right now, as they're looking at exchanges that they can trust,
 what are some things without naming names that you would look at or things that should
 make your eyebrows go up when you see it as a person who has built an exchange?
 I think, I guess, you start off deciding what is your reason for wanting to use an exchange.
 Are you someone who wants to speculate, is comfortable with the risk of speculating?
 I think, effectively, somewhere between the spectrum of trader to gambler.
 That's the spectrum.
 Some people consider them all the same thing.
 Some people consider them different.
 But if that's where your mindset is, you should be open and true to yourself, in which case
 everything is about risk.
 You should be focused on who has the most features, who has the most liquidity, and
 just accept that there's a risk that they could blow up as a business.
 But that's just one more risk you're taking along with the trading risk.
 If you are someone who is interested in using this as a custodian for holding your value
 in the long run, you see this as a savings technology as opposed to a speculation technology,
 then you should have a very different set of criteria.
 It isn't about who's the biggest name.
 It's about who has a consistent commitment to focus on social capital over financial
 capital.
 It's more important for them to maintain honor and dignity and a good reputation.
 And their actions have shown that over the short term money.
 They want to make money, of course, because they have to be profitable.
 But they want to make sure that they maintain their own social credibility, and that's a
 high value for them.
 So the first thing you do now, how do you do that?
 Well, you look for signs and symbols.
 So one, how they speak, what they talk about, what they prioritize.
 Do they have a clear set of criteria for what they list?
 And is that criteria based on the safety of their users?
 Or is the criteria based on how much money they can make from their users?
 If it's the prime first, then this is probably the biggest indicator.
 If it's the first, then that's a good sign.
 If it's the second, that is a sign that probably the place to go if you want to speculate.
 Now if they don't clearly communicate their criteria, or they communicate it but don't
 follow it, those are both, you should assume in that scenario that they're in the latter
 camp.
 Unfortunately, the vast majority of exchanges are in that latter camp.
 What we found is we came up with criteria, which are just very sensible.
 We thought one, we would only list items which were technically mature, because if you're
 asking people to have money with something which is not technically mature, there's a
 high risk it could explode, and that's not good for your customer.
 It can make a lot of money for you, but it's not good for the customer.
 Two, you would list something which had very good community support, because if it didn't,
 it could fluctuate a lot, it could disappear, money has network effects, you need such strong
 community support.
 So again, these are very sensible criteria.
 Small cap tokens and so on didn't make sense there.
 Three, there needed to be regulatory clarity, because we're a regulated exchange, you need
 to have regulatory clarity around the token.
 And four, ultimately you want these things to store a value, money, so it needs to have
 a core use case which was around storing value and money.
 Because if it wasn't, then it wasn't a thing to store your value in, and if you're thinking
 of customers you want to save, that didn't make sense.
 Now when you take those four criteria, and we thought they were four very sensible criteria
 for if you're focusing on customers trying to save, and dollar cost average, or sensibly
 invest and hold for the long run, we only found one currency that actually fit those
 four criteria, which was Bitcoin.
 So when I say that I'm a Bitcoin maximist, I just think it's actually from a very rational
 position.
 If I found something else that met those four criteria, I would have listed it, but I've
 never found anything that came close to those four, which is why...
 And Bitcoin only just meets those four, by the way.
 Even Bitcoin only just meets those four.
 Otherwise if it didn't, then we would just shut up shop and say, "Well, there's nothing
 to offer people."
 But Bitcoin does meet that criteria, and we were reviewing it every month, and it was
 only Bitcoin.
 And in fact, with further decisions by other cryptocurrencies, they've further and further
 gone away from being able to fit those criteria.
 So for example, Ethereum, you might think it fits three of those criteria, but in terms
 of technical readiness, the Ethereum developers decided and announced publicly that Ethereum
 2 was coming out because Ethereum was never going to meet the original objectives of the
 Ethereum community, of the Ethereum developers.
 So if the developers of Ethereum say it's not good enough, objectively it's not good
 enough at that stage.
 So at that point, it was very obvious that we list Ethereum after only listing it for
 six months.
 That was only a short period.
 And so we delisted it at that point because the developers of Ethereum themselves were
 telling you it's not good enough.
 Preston Pysh (00:34:40): Yeah, you don't want to argue with them.
 So Obi, you are a board member on B-Trust.
 This is a nonprofit.
 Talk to us about what this is about.
 Obi Wan (00:34:58): B-Trust, and it's B is the Bitcoin B, and
 B-Trust.
 It's always difficult to type, to find that symbol.
 We need to make it as a permanent character on the keyboard.
 So it was originally a year, over a year ago, Jack Dorsey and Jay-Z tweeted this idea that
 they're putting 500 Bitcoin towards a trust to promote the development of Bitcoin protocol
 engineers in the global South, starting in Africa and India, but ultimately all across
 the global South.
 And so they were on the lookout for board members, three to four board members to take
 this 500 Bitcoin, form this trust, and locate, educate, and renumerate talented Bitcoin engineers
 so that they could hopefully become the next generation of Bitcoin protocol engineers.
 Because there are only a few people who actively work on some of these.
 vital, globally vital technology. So lightning, Bitcoin core and other core protocols. So the
 idea was great. The impact is also great, because if you take Bitcoin core, it's talking to the
 two main core Bitcoin core maintainers in Oslo a month and a half ago. And they're saying actually
 right now, although there's a few hundred people who contribute, the people who actively contribute
 to Bitcoin core, for example, is about 10 right now. And you can see Peter Willer just announced
 stepping down so it could be even less. So even if you add one or two or three people to that,
 you're making a significant increase in and this is a point where the global south is not only
 you're helping increase the education of the global south, but they're going to then contribute
 to something that is of global importance. So the global south is supporting the world as opposed
 to the West supporting the global south. So love the idea. I applied with 7000 plus other people
 because it was an open invitation. I didn't want to have these things where I was back rooms,
 you know, old boys club type application. And I know many people from from the Bitcoin space
 applied, but many people from outside it applied as well. And so began 10 month process. This also
 began in the same year that I was already looking to move on from Cornfall. And there's a reason why
 I'm and I was all because I started to realize that we needed to get a lot of people off exchanges,
 but that's something we'll talk about in a bit. So over that 10 months, while I was still working
 on coin floor, but looking at starting to look at offers before I just didn't ignore them, but
 starting to look seriously at offers to acquire the company, we went from 7000 people applied.
 And then a few months later, I went to the next round, the next round, and at some point,
 around just before adopting Bitcoin in San Salvador, which I was planning to go to,
 because at that point was getting close to us finding buyers, we're in the last negotiation
 phase. And I had finally opportunity to do things like to go to hackers Congress for the first time
 in Prague, as a CEO of a regulated exchange, it's not a good look to go to Congress. But now I know
 I'm selling it, finally do that. And to go to San Salvador, I got down to the last like,
 few hundred, I believe. And then I thought, okay, then maybe there's a chance here.
 And yeah, we kept on going through and then it was final interviews. And just a few days before
 I was about to sell the business was pure coincidence. We it was finally announced that
 I was going to be one of the four board members, we had our board meeting with
 Jack and Jay on the call and all these other incredible people who'd helped given donated
 their time from spiral from chain code from brink from just everywhere. And yeah, we the four board
 members met each other for the first time on that call as well. We introduced ourselves to everybody.
 And so it began. I mean, it was formally announced on the same day as I stepped down as a director of
 CoinFlow just by pure coincidence the same day. I only think my other board members know that
 happened. So one life ended and then new life began. Insane. Everybody listening to this right
 now is doing a fist pump in the air like that is awesome. That is so cool. I'm really blessed
 the people I'm working with are incredible and amazing. Wow. So you had mentioned Lightning and
 Core, obviously. So do you see Fediment in that mix of protocols potentially moving forward?
 How does the board view Fediment? Is it something that's been brought up?
 Yeah. I mean, we have a number of principles that we put on our site. And one is I'm very careful
 not to bring up Fediment in B-Trust meetings. Other people have and sometimes candidates that
 we talk to have brought it up, which is really good because there's so much just natural excitement for
 it. So that's actually... But what I don't want to do is be seen to be promoting something that
 I'm working on. And that's one of our policies as board members to not try to promote our own bags,
 as it were, even though this is an open source project. But I do fundamentally see this as
 the third key pillar of the Bitcoin open source ecosystem.
 What are the first two? What are the first two, Bobby?
 The first one, the central pillar is Bitcoin Core itself, Bitcoin. So this is decentralized
 censorship resistance, store of value of money. That's the base that everything else is built
 across. Fixed supply, immutable, decentralized, and also very, very secure. In terms of extra
 function, the sacrifice it makes is it's not got very much functionality and so on. And that's where
 other technologies can add to it over time. But it needs to be as a base, very, very, very secure,
 and very, very decentralized. And what you don't want to have is compromise those two for bells
 and whistles in the core protocol. Because if you're compromising on centralization,
 then what's the point of using a blockchain? It's a massive overhead. You might as well use
 a database. If you're compromising on security, then you end up with something like terror,
 and so on. Why would you store money on something that's insecure? It's eventually going to be lost.
 It makes no sense either. So you cannot compromise on those two.
 The next pillar is decentralized censorship-resistant payments. And that has been
 provided through Lightning. And that allows you to, if you're set up correctly, and the network
 is architected correctly, from a scaling and congestion point of view, allows you to settle
 between parties at the speed of Lightning and at incredibly low cost. So that allows you to scale
 the payments aspect, but it's built on top of the first layer. And then the third pillar,
 which is missing, is decentralized censorship-resistant custody. And at the moment,
 if you think about it, we've really got two choices. You come along, and you're someone
 who's passionate about Bitcoin, knowledge about Bitcoin. It's invariably friends and family.
 When they're in the, when it's the right phase in the bear period, no one wants to talk to you,
 and you're the social pariah. But in the bull period, everybody comes back and goes,
 "You're the one who always goes on about Bitcoin. Can I actually, can you tell me?"
 Well, they first will ask you for financial advice. They say, "Where can I buy it from?"
 And whatever you say, because they trust you, they're going to do. But you really have two
 choices. You can either tell, you take a view. Are these people technically proficient enough?
 Then maybe you suggest to go with a hardware wallet approach. But for nine times out of 10,
 you don't think they are, especially early on. So then your only choice is to tell them to go
 to a regulated exchange, even though you know that's not a good thing to do. That's literally
 the only way to do it. And that's not centralized. And you're basically telling them to store their
 money with a stranger, effectively. It's stranger custody, by definition, third-party custody.
 What we need is a solution which is much simpler to use, and also can be rolled out anywhere. It's
 decentralized. It's censorship resistant, which is not the case for a regulated exchange. And
 it allows you to custody safely and securely. And ideally, just like lightning, baked in privacy
 into the standard, because everybody needs it, but they don't actively do stuff for it.
 Your custody solution should also do that. You shouldn't have to go off and do extra things
 to get privacy. It should be just baked in and you shouldn't even think about it.
 So that is missing. And FediMint provides that. I can go into how I discovered it and discovered
 the person who invented it. Yeah. I have that as a question here. I wanted to hear how,
 because you don't know this person, correct? Oh, well, now I do know him.
 Okay. But at the time I didn't. As I mentioned last year, in the final few months of negotiating
 sale of CoinFlow, I decided to visit Hackers Congress. And I was going there for two reasons.
 One, I've always wanted to go, but I just felt as the CEO of a regulated exchange,
 it wasn't appropriate for me to go to certain events at the time. But this time I thought,
 "Well, now I can go. It doesn't matter." And I've always wanted to go. But there was another reason.
 In 2019, it seems that there's a segment that's related. The Financial Action Taskforce, FATER,
 approved something called the Travel Rule. At that time, people who were in the industry,
 especially who were very afraid of what was happening in regulation,
 realized how significant this was going to be. The FADF is this unelected body who advises
 regulators around the world on appropriate regulation. But that's just advice. But
 throughout the history of FATER, there's no piece of advice they've ever given that hasn't been
 unanimously implemented by the different countries who have signed up to the FADF
 policies. But almost every country in the world has signed up to the FADF policies.
 Even if they're warring with each other or so on, they've all signed up.
 Now, the only question is how long it takes to implement. The quickest,
 smallest, agile countries do it in about three years. The less agile ones take five, six years.
 But they all do it eventually. So, 2019 was when the clock started.
 And as you can see, we're in 2022. We're now at the period where you're starting to see the
 countries implement it. And many people think, "Well, this is not going to be implemented." But
 there is not a situation of a policy implemented by FADF that hasn't been implemented. So,
 knowing this, I realized that as we were getting close to this timeline, that we needed to get
 more people off exchanges. We as an exchange, and again, as an exchange, you're generally not
 incentivized to do this. But again, an exchange who's concerned about their customers would be
 one that's constantly trying to get them to self-custody. If they're not trying to do that,
 or they're trying to explain why it's better to custody with them, again, you need to be careful
 if your objective is to save. If it's a trade and gamble, it's a different thing.
 So, we were constantly trying to get people to self-custody. And after a number of years,
 I realized that this was just not going to happen. We might get 5% self-custody,
 but we're never going to get anywhere near 100%. One day, one of our customers,
 amazing woman, really funny, and now a very good friend of mine, very smart switched on,
 but not super technical. So, like, "Obi, I get it. I understand what you're saying. And I
 understand I should self-custody. But the problem is I trust you more than I trust myself."
 I think you have a lot of this, Obi. I think you have a ton of this.
 You do. You do. And I realized that this was what was stopping most people moving across.
 So, I asked her and I thought about it. "Well, who do you trust more than me as an exchange?"
 And she thought about it and she went, "Well, I guess my friends and family, because
 they're the ones I asked for where to custody." And they suggested you. And they could have
 suggested Wibble Wobble Exchange. I would have just gone with what they've said. So,
 implicitly, I trust them more than you. I only use you because they told me to use you.
 And so, that was something I, to use a Sherlock Holmesism, I stored in my mind palace. It was
 up there. But then I just left it. But then a number of years later, I was at Hacker's Congress
 thinking about ways in which we could help get people off exchanges. I also had a very strong
 interest in the global South, especially even more so, it's always been running through my
 experience at CoinFlow, but it's just never going to happen. A UK regulated exchange with UK
 and European based traditional finance based investors, they were never going to have Nigeria
 as the second market. It was just not going to happen. But I'd always wanted to do this.
 And I also realized that self-custody and the hardware wallet solutions don't work in places
 where if you send 100,000 or 10,000 hardware wallets to Nigeria, you're lucky if 1% get
 through and don't get stolen on the way in libraries. Or in certain regimes, are they
 going to be sabotaged or all this sort of stuff? It just doesn't, it works in a Western context,
 but it doesn't work there. So, I was thinking about ideas like using existing things that
 were already there, like Nokia phones, they're everywhere. They're used as doorstops in most
 places now, but they have the functionality and power to be hardware wallets, for example,
 and they pre-existed the invention of Bitcoin. So, it's hard to think that chips could have
 been added to something before the threat was actually in existence. So, I was looking to talk,
 I was talking to some of the hackers and cypherpunks there about how we could redeploy
 them. And then at one lunch break, we were outside the front of Paranili police, if I pronounced it
 correctly, where hackers congress takes place. And I bumped into L. Sirian, Eric Sirian. And
 he was wearing his cap and sunglasses and face mask and so on and so forth, because he's very
 privacy focused. And I told him about my ideas, and he gave me very, very honest feedback. I
 thought these ideas were terrible. And I really appreciate it, because I like to get good feedback
 on these things. And then I wanted to hear about his ideas. And he then told me about Fedimint,
 which is a portmanteau of federated Xiaomi and Mint. And I listened to the idea, and I thought,
 this is a really interesting idea, but isn't it going to be stopped by regulators and so on and
 so forth? Because I've had eight years of background dealing with regulators, dealing with
 some of the largest law firms in the world, regulatory advisors, and so on. And so, I had
 a very strong knowledge of all the different regulations that are happening in places.
 And he said, well, I don't really think about that. I'm just making this incredible privacy
 system, which it was. But then I thought about it for a bit, and I realized, well,
 if these people who are, and I can explain how it works in a bit, but if the people who are
 running these nodes, effectively, these Fedimint nodes, we now call them guardians.
 If these people are friends and family, or they have some sort of pre-existing
 non-commercial relationship, and if they are not looking to do this by way of business,
 they're basically not earning money. I mean, they can earn money if they want,
 and certain jurisdictions are fine with that. And if the way federations work, it means that they
 don't have a majority of keys, they have a minority of keys, they can't act single-handedly,
 then through various exemptions, they will be exempt from, depending on the jurisdiction,
 they'll be exempt from regulation in most reasonable jurisdictions. By that, I mean
 Europe, UK, and US, for example. They'll be exempt from regulation.
 Preston Pysh (00:34:40): As long as they're not doing it for profit,
 you're saying?
 Addy Osman (00:34:44): There's multiple things that the system does,
 and the design is designed to make it so that the people operating it have a strong case to be
 exempt from regulation. So one is, and this is very clear, you can see it on the very helpful
 websites for the FCA, for example, is this guide, do you need to be regulated or not? And one clear
 exemption is, are you doing this by way of business? And then it goes, well, how do you
 know it's doing by way of business? Well, there's no hard and fast rules, and they never give hard
 and fast rules, they're examples. Are you looking to make a profit from it, to make revenue? Well,
 so if you say I'm not, and also if you add on things like, well, if you add on that you're
 doing it for people you have pre-existing relationships with, and they're not, and it's
 friends and family, that also just adds to the argument that you're not doing it by way of
 business. If you can think of the idea, if I'm going to store money in a piggy bank for my kid,
 I don't need to regulate it, it's a licensed custodian. If I go to the shop and buy stuff
 for a friend, I don't need to regulate it as a payment institute, they give me money to buy
 stuff for them. Or if I buy something in a restaurant and I said, I'll pay you, you can
 pay me back next week, I don't need to be a credit institute to do that, because I'm doing it not by
 way of business. And it's the same, if you are holding your private keys for, if someone has
 got a hardware wallet, and then they ask you to hold a backup of their private keys, that backup
 is also the wallet. But we realize that that's not regulated, because you're not doing it by
 way of business. But you are literally custodying their money as well by holding that backup of
 their private keys. And most people will be storing the back of their private keys with friends,
 or hopefully, or they might be storing it in a bank vault, but in which case, you're still storing
 your money in a regulated third party bank, in that case, in which case, why use the hardware
 wallet if you're going to store your backup in a third party regulated institution. So,
 you know, all of these things, you don't expect those to be regulated. And it's the same thing
 here. It's effectively, FediMint is the same as you storing the keys for as a backup for your
 friends, but just on steroids. And we're taking the best practice way of doing that, i.e., you
 should be storing them as cryptographically secure shares, and then splitting it up amongst a number
 of trusted friends. That's what you get automatically when you join a FediMint
 Federation. Let's take a quick break and hear from today's sponsors.

 Stig Brodersen (00:15:15): All right. Back to the show.
 Talk to us through, explain an example. Let's say that you, me, and four other friends,
 so there's six of us. Is that kind of a federation size that you see this
 playing out in application? And then walk us through what that application would look like.
 Roy Bhandari (00:15:37): So that's all a matter of experimentation.
 And it's also very flexible. It's a technology, it's a protocol, and we're going to see a lot of
 experimentation. If I talk to 30 people, I get 30 different topologies of how it could be set up,
 which is great because that tells you that this is a really flexible tool. But let's just take
 one example. Before I do that, go back to the last point. When I realized that was the case,
 that it was possible to be exempt from regulation, but the experience, then I realized that this was
 far more than just a privacy technology. This was a decentralized custody offering.
 You could have the user experience of an exchange, but better. You can have privacy levels,
 which are better than both an exchange and a hardware wallet. You could have access to the
 Lightning Network as in natively, and you could also have a level of custody security, which was
 very strong, approaching that of a hardware wallet, but it was still a software solution,
 which can be delivered anywhere in the world for free. This was decentralized,
 censorship-resistant custody. And so that's why I became really excited and I wanted to do
 everything to support it off that point. But let's go back to your question about a given
 example. Let's say you and some other friends of yours are Bitcoiners through and through,
 and you run your own four nodes. And you're always going to get friends and family who want you to
 become like their Uncle Jim to support them. I think that's the phrase. To support them and help
 them provide them advice, maybe help buy Bitcoin on behalf, maybe hold some for them, et cetera.
 But you're then taking a lot of risk on it. And if something were to happen to you, you lose your
 own Bitcoin, but now it's something that's yours and their Bitcoin, which is extra stress.
 You could then say, and also your Bitcoin, you want to work out, how am I going to
 hold my 24-word backup seed securely? And again, if you go to sites like 10x Bitcoin Security,
 Glacier Protocol, all these things, the recommendation will be multi-signature custody.
 And then where do you store those different multi-signature keys? With trusted friends
 and family. So what you'll do is you take your Bitcoin nodes, you install the FedEmint
 software as well. It needs a full Bitcoin node running, but the FedEmint services only adds a
 very little additional overhead to that. And then with a little bit of configuration,
 just like you have to configure your Lightning node or Bitcoin node, a little bit of configuration,
 mainly just putting the IP addresses of the other Federation members, the system will
 form a Federation. They will connect to each other. They will form a multi-sig wallet.
 And that's it. And then just like Bitcoin, and to a lesser extent Lightning, but just very much
 like Bitcoin, once you do that, you can just... The idea is you just keep it running. Other than
 the odd bit of maintenance, running out of hard drive space or something like that,
 you just have to keep it fed and watered with electricity and internet. And that's it.
 Preston Pysh (00:40:40):
 So let's say the six participants in this network, let's just say we have six and each one of us has
 Bitcoin on an exchange, all six of us. And now we're going to deposit it into our own local
 addresses inside of that Federated network that we just established. So we all have our own private
 keys or walk us through what something like that would look like.
 Adwoa Boateng (00:41:00): So it's a multi-signature address. So each
 person has their own private key, but then they use their private keys to form a multi-signature
 address, which requires a subset of the keys to sign a transaction.
 Preston Pysh (00:41:13): So three of six, if we decided that, or four of six?
 Adwoa Boateng (00:41:19): Let's say five people and it's three of five,
 or if it was six, you'd probably want to go again. You could do whatever you want, but I'd
 probably suggest you to go for four of six. So you need an absolute majority of the transaction.
 But let's just say you wanted to go with six and you choose to have a four of six multi-signature.
 So each person will take their own private key that they manage themselves, but then they would
 put in the IP addresses of the other Federation members. It will create a multi-signature address,
 which requires four of those six keys to sign. And if you lose any two of those six keys,
 you can still keep ticking along and still keep signing. So it provides a bus factor of three.
 So it needs at least three people before it stops being signed. And you have a, and you need at
 least a majority of four people to sign as well. So no one person, and in that case, no two people
 can cause the system to stop. And also it will keep going and also vice versa.
 So that forms this multi-signature address. Now, at that point, to send money to anyone of you,
 you would send it to the same multi-signature address. But when a deposit comes in, there'll
 be additional information that we passed along that will allow you to know which address that's
 related to. So for example, if it was on chain, you'd create an address and the Federation,
 the FediMint Federation will know that this address, just like when you use an exchange,
 an address is created and it's associated with a user, that address will temporarily be associated
 with a user as well. And so when the deposit comes in, Federation knows that that's allocated
 to a given user. Now, here's the thing. Unlike an exchange where you have this concept of accounts
 and user count one, two, three, four, there are no accounts, there's no permanent accounts in a
 FediMint Federation. A temporary account is set up just to receive the money, but it's not actually
 attached to a person. Instead, what's implemented internally, as well as this multi-signature
 wallet, is a Chaumian Mint. So a Chaumian Mint is a privacy, or Chaumian eCash is a privacy protocol
 that was invented by David Chowm in actually 1983. And it was used in his company DigiCash,
 which was one of the first sort of e-money systems. Now, this protocol is actually very elegant,
 relatively simple. It's obviously using very mature maths because it's
 It was invented in 1983, so we're talking about 40 years old now, four decades old.
 And in theory, it provides for cryptographically perfect privacy.
 Not near perfect, not Monero near perfect or Zcash, trusted startup perfect, cryptographically
 perfect privacy.
 And it's been around for a long time as well, using very mature cryptography.
 The only problem was that it required a centralized bank to receive your cash, whatever that cash
 would be.
 This is unreal.
 And then on the back of that, when they received money in, you'd receive in its place these
 digital tokens, which would effectively be e-cash, what they call e-cash.
 So you can think of it conceptually like you're going to a fairground with lots of different
 rights, lots of different things you can do, and you go there with your family and your
 children, etc.
 You go to the front and there's no money for the rights.
 You have to buy tokens for everything.
 So you get to the entrance and there will be a cashier or a teller.
 You give them some cash and then they would give you tokens.
 Once you receive those tokens, let's say the mother buys these tokens, she can give some
 to her husband, some to her children, and they can go off.
 They can go around, see a friend, pass them to a friend within the confines of this fairground.
 These are bearer instruments, tokens.
 And it's the same with e-cash.
 Each day you have literally a different token for every single individual coin.
 So in the same way, if you want to give someone five pounds fifty, you have to give them five
 pound notes.
 I'm just saying pounds because of my British background.
 But five dollars, fifty cents, for example, or fifty two cents.
 You give them a five dollar note and then you will or let's say six dollars.
 You give them a five dollar note, a one dollar note, and then you give them a fifty cents
 coin and two cents coin.
 In the same way, it will be the same with e-cash.
 You have to do the same.
 You have to create, you'll add them to tokens together to add to the number.
 So it acts exactly like conceptually how you think cash works.
 When people talk about Bitcoin, how they naively think it works, that's exactly what they find
 out later it doesn't work that way.
 Cash works the way you naively and intuitively think digital cash should work within the
 confines of the domain of the Federation.
 So one Federation member can send the e-cash tokens directly to another as well.
 But where the cryptography comes in is it provides this ability for these tokens to
 be signed but in a blinded manner.
 So basically a user can receive the tokens, blind them locally, send them to the mint.
 The mint will then stamp them to say this is valid and then return it back.
 And then the user can unblind them and now they can spend them.
 But the mint never knew who requested it for it to be blinded.
 So to stretch the metaphor of the fairgrounds, you can imagine it's the same fairground but
 it's still this big glass window.
 You replace it, you brick it up and all of the people in the front can see is this hole
 where money comes in and they give back tokens or tokens come in and give back money.
 If you add that addition, that's the blinding, then you effectively do not know how many
 people are in the fairgrounds, who's got what and also most of the transactions don't even
 need to interact with you for long periods of time, only if they want to blind them and
 to prevent double spending.
 But again, you won't know who it is.
 So with this deposit coming in for one of your users, you would have some sort of shared
 secret which the person who's receiving the money would have known and they will therefore
 add that shared secret to this address.
 And then when the money comes in, once it arrives, they can then provide you some information
 to prove that they're the ones who are the right recipients for that money that came
 in and therefore you release it to them and you issue tokens to them.
 But that way you can issue tokens to someone based off a deposit coming in without knowing
 who you're issuing tokens for.
 So the Charlie Mint system allows you to hold money on behalf of someone without knowing
 who you're holding it for, allows you to receive deposits for someone and pass it on to them
 without knowing who it is that you're passing it on for.
 And also the opposite can happen.
 Someone can send back tokens to you, which you then destroy because you mint the tokens
 and you destroy them.
 And you can then send off Bitcoin on-chain or over the Lightning Network without knowing
 who made that request.
 So it provides very simple request cryptography and perfect privacy.
 What was the additional innovation?
 And someone actually theorized this in 2002, actually, someone recently showed a paper
 that someone thought, Charlie Mint, lots of people have looked at them again and again.
 Someone thought that Charlie Mint would be great, but maybe as a way for us to decentralize
 the bank.
 But they didn't think about how to do it, but it was proposed.
 And then a year and a half, two years ago, Eric Sirian looked at the idea of that was
 popularized by Blockstream of federations with Liquid, where you're taking this one
 address and you're federating amongst multiple people and thought, well, instead of having
 this sort of global scale federation, why don't we apply this technology to Charlie
 and Mint and we federate the bank so that it's not just one person, but a number of
 people work together to provide the service of this Charlie and Mint.
 And that was where the idea of removing one of its main weaknesses, which was the fact
 that it was one centralized actor, and it's been solved that by federating a centralized
 actor and federated Charlie and Mint were born.
 And then where I came in, I realized how you could have a use case where it could be exempt
 from regulation, which would...
 And if you look at a modern exchange, 80 to 85% of people working there one way or another
 are only there because of regulation.
 So if you are exempt from regulation, it just simplifies everything and it makes it global
 scale.
 Do other people know the size of the transactions?
 So if there was a substantial transaction inside the federation, would the other participants
 know the size of that?
 No, the other participants wouldn't know the size.
 And the federation guardians, the people who are running the federation servers, will be
 very limited in what information they would have about the size.
 They will be aware of the type of coins used.
 So they might know that you use a combination of $5 coins, or let's just put it in sats,
 you use some 0.1 Bitcoin coins, some number of 0.01 coins, and some number of 0.001 coins.
 But you won't know.
 That's to the extent that they would have awareness, but they wouldn't know how much
 of each.
 You could have used a million of one or one of one.
 They won't.
 If we wanted to and you only had one denomination of coins, then you wouldn't even know that.
 But that's where there's the theoretical perfect privacy.
 You would only get perfect if you had one denomination only, because then they would
 just know some number of coins was used.
 But you lose some information because you do know the denominations, but that's still
 incredible levels of privacy.
 So let's say that somebody, a member of the federation, wants to send some of their coins
 onto an exchange, call it CoinFloor, and they're doing it.
 Let's play two different scenarios, because my understanding, or at least my perception
 of how this works is you can do this with Lightning Bitcoin, layer two, or you can do
 it with layer one Bitcoin setting up these federations.
 So let's say that they take funds, they deposit it over at an exchange through both of those
 scenarios.
 Let's say they do it on layer one and then they do it on layer two.
 Is the exchange receiving those coins the same way that they are before any of this
 protocol would potentially ever be set up?
 Yeah, from the layer point of view, it appears like a normal Lightning transaction, a normal
 Bitcoin transaction.
 But in a Bitcoin transaction, ultimately, the e-cash is only within the domain of the
 federation.
 But outside the federation, the federation will destroy the tokens that are being spent
 and then release to the address that it's been instructed to send to an on-chain transaction,
 for example.
 If you're sending a Lightning transaction, what will happen is a Lightning service provider
 would also have a connection, be connected to the mint.
 And you as the user can connect up to your own Lightning service provider.
 You don't have to actually interact with the guardians to do this.
 But what would happen is you would send your e-cash tokens to the Lightning service provider
 and they then, in a trustless way, would effectively, because it effectively emulates the logic
 of a hashed time lock contract, but where one part is e-cash as opposed to one part
 being on-chain or on-network.
 And then they would, with their own Bitcoin within their own channels, send off Bitcoin
 over the Lightning network to the address sent.
 But from the recipient's point of view, they receive a Lightning transaction.
 And so what would happen is their channel balance would go down, but their e-cash balance
 of the LSP would go up.
 The beauty of that approach is that means the LSP needs to have some trust for the guardians.
 So they will probably know the guardians as well or be comfortable with them, be part
 of the community as well.
 But the Federation members don't have to have any trust for the Lightning service provider.
 So in one way.
 And they don't have to also lock up any balance.
 The Federation doesn't need to lock up any balance on-chain or on-network as well.
 And because it's not locking up balance, there's nothing to stop a Federation having connections
 to multiple different LSPs.
 So if one's balance channels were exhausted, for example, you could load balance over to
 another LSP, for example, immediately and provide a much more reliable payment experience
 for your users because you're not locking up funds.
 But it's also great for the LSPs because having after a four and a half hour conversation
 with René Picard about this, FediMint represents an ideal counterparty for an LSP.
 If you imagine you have two choices, connecting to 500 intermittent Lightning nodes with small
 amounts of balance and locking up balance amongst all of them to cover potential scenarios
 for all of them.
 So you have to over collateralize for these 500s.
 And they're also up and down irregularly so that you're constantly, your network graph
 of how to route traffic is constantly changing and having to be recalculated, which is very
 expensive for you and leads to a much lower reliability of your transactions.
 Or you connect to one party who represents the volume of 500 people.
 And it also is run by a Federation of members who are running it reliably.
 And as long as a majority of them are running, it stays up.
 So its reliability and uptime is much higher.
 And it also represents much more volume.
 It's only one connection.
 So you now need to just put a lock up an amount of balance, which is based on the average
 for all of them, as opposed to trying to figure out for every individual user who may never
 use it for a month and then use it once, you have to lock up.
 You get much more consistent revenue for much lower costs, allowing you to become much more
 profitable from it.
 So it's actually, and if it's much more profitable, you incentivize more people setting up like
 this.
 And without realizing this, FediMint, widespread use of FediMint actually makes the Lightning
 Network more reliable, more profitable, which again, grows the Lightning Network as well.
 So when I realized that, that was the final straw.
 All the incentives were aligned.
 Yeah.
 All the incentives were aligned.
 Yeah, it had to happen.
 Exactly.
 Unreal.
 Unreal.
 The more you hear about it, the more you realize that this is the missing piece of
 the Bitcoin open source ecosystem.
 It provides at rest, very good privacy, incredible privacy.
 It actually, in a community context, we haven't even gone into the beauty of how you do social
 recovery so that you don't have to worry about the challenge of what you do with a 24-hour
 seed, or how do you recover it?
 And ultimately, even how do you deal with it in the event of your death and inheritance
 planning and so on, all covered.
 And it solves that problem, which is an important problem to solve, especially as time goes
 by.
 Because right now, if you're doing it in a first party custody context, it's very complex.
 If you think about it, again, if you can do the first party custody approach, you should
 have at it, you should do it.
 But if you want to do it properly, it's complex.
 You need to get a good hardware wallet, you need to be able to get it to be delivered
 to you, that costs money as well.
 So you've got that.
 You then need to work out what you do, which is the hard bit, what you do with your 24-hour
 seed.
 Because there's no point having this Fort Knox level security with AI, artificial intelligence,
 robo-controlled shots in a moat in front of it.
 Then you go around the back where your 24-hour seed is and there's an open door because it's
 stored with a magnet on your fridge, your 24-hour seed.
 It sort of defeats the purpose.
 I met someone the other day who's a hardcore Bitcoiner, and this is not recommended, but
 he memorized his 24-hour seed because he just couldn't think of somewhere else he could
 be comfortable storing it.
 And I go, "What happens in the case of your debt and your family?"
 He said, "Well, my loved ones have a copy of the key."
 And I go, "Where do they store it?"
 "I don't know where they store it."
 "Well, but that's your security level."
 Yeah, that's right.
 And it's the thing, you have to remember that is a security level.
 And the more you think about it, then what you do is you go online, you check out 10X
 Bitcoin security, Bitcoin security guide, and so on.
 And they will tell you, the ideal thing you want to do when all is said and done is for
 most people, unless you're willing to go to the grave with your keys and contribute your
 Bitcoin to the world for inflation, which is something we're willing to do, and I respect
 that.
 But if you do want to pass it on to anybody, then you're going to want to make sure it's
 reliably custody.
 Or if you do want to recover it in the event that you lose your credit card, and so on.
 And the best practice way is to use multi-signature M of N type custody.
 And then where do you store each one of those?
 You store them with third party, with second party's friends, family, trusted friends,
 family, reliable people that you've known and they hold it for you.
 And that's not by way of business, they're not making profits, they are friends and family,
 but they are still custody in a decentralized manner, your Bitcoin.
 And then you want them to be people that you think can be reliably custodying your Bitcoin.
 That should be the best practice.
 That's exactly what you get out of the box when you use FedErent.
 You get the best practice by doing nothing but just downloading a mobile app and a federation
 will have an address.
 You enter the address or scan the QR code and you're done.
 No passports, no driving license, no selfies, but also no figuring out what you do with
 a 24-hour seat.
 It gets immediately cryptographically split into shards using Shamir's secret sharing
 scheme, which is cryptographically split up.
 And then it gets split and then it gets shared amongst third guardians, who are by definition
 your trusted third parties.
 They're trusted in your community to be the knights of the community, the sort of reliable
 people who ideally value social capital more than they value financial capital.
 And anybody can custody it, but I have to decide the choice of who's going to hold my
 money, somebody who's motivated by money, somebody who's motivated by social capital.
 I know which one I would choose out of those two to hold my money.
 So that's the idea.
 Preston Pysh (00:36:40): So Obi, my understanding is you're currently
 working on an application that simplifies setting up a federation.
 And I'm curious how far along you are in that process.
 And more importantly, who is the audience or who is this intended for and what solution
 are you providing through what you're building?
 Obi Winfrey (00:37:02): FediMint and the product that we're making
 is called FedEye based on FediMint, but it's just a nice simple name and it reminds me
 of or reminds us of Jedi.
 So these guardians are like Jedi knights almost.
 Preston Pysh (00:37:16): And you got the perfect name for that.
 Obi Winfrey (00:37:18): I got the perfect name for it, but I look
 more like Mace Windu, who is Samuel L. Jackson's character, to be honest.
 I'm probably more of a Mace Windu than Obi-Wan Kenobi.
 Justin Moon, who's one of my co-founders with his mullet, is very much like the younger
 Obi-Wan actually.
 We were discussing this the other day.
 So he's probably Obi-Wan Kenobi.
 And so I don't know who El-Syrian would be.
 Maybe he would be Yoda because he's the one who came up with the idea.
 We haven't decided who El-Syrian is.
 But yeah, so it's called FedEye and it's a very simple app.
 But ultimately, this is global scale Bitcoin custody.
 It's for everybody and anyone who wants to not custody on an exchange, but wants an incredibly
 simple experience, very secure, lightning first, and also with privacy by default, which
 is basically everybody I think would want something like that.
 But what has made me really passionate in the last few months is to see how it can help
 as part of everybody, the billions of users who are excluded from the currency options.
 So if you are able to meet the cuts to be on a regulated exchange and you're comfortable
 with the risks and trade-offs, which we've seen quite recently with some of the recent
 things that even regulated exchanges still can make you lose your money.
 Or if you have the technical chops and you are adding the money to properly self-custody,
 that's great.
 But if you haven't got those two, really you're still talking about billions of users who
 don't meet those two criteria, either for reasons of complexity or for reasons of regulation,
 they're excluded from custodying Bitcoin.
 And these include some of the most oppressed people in the world.
 A couple of months ago, I was invited by Alex Gladstein to the Oslo Freedom Forum, and I
 got to hear some of the most heart-wrenching but also encouraging stories of bravery against
 oppression around the world, generally in the global south, but also in Eastern Europe
 with Ukraine and Russia, what's happening there.
 And all of these people are coming to the realization that a big part of the challenge
 is money.
 These regimes are powered by money.
 They often use inflation, aggressive levels of inflation as a tool to extract money from
 their people, even if the people don't want to give them money.
 Inflation is a very powerful tax.
 And if you take examples like Venezuela with 20,000% inflation right now, come down from
 50,000% inflation.
 Even if you're donating or sending money back to your friends and family in that country,
 what you're effectively doing is donating to the regime, which you may not support,
 but without realizing you're supporting.
 So they need a solution, but they need a solution that can be deployed anywhere, and it doesn't
 cost a lot of money, it's not going to be stopped in customs, it's hardware wallets,
 and they can't wait years to be onboarded through a regulatory process, through regulated
 exchanges, each one going through KYC, and ultimately many of them not even being approved.
 FediMint solves that problem, but it needs a very simple user interface for that.
 So having realized that, and having formed really strong relationships with some of these
 incredible brave individuals, it's become a passion of ours to not only offer this to
 the world, but with a specific focus on working with some of these people to roll this out
 at scale in some of the places that need it the most.
 And the good thing is, if it works there, it can work anywhere.
 So it's for everybody, but that's actually a key part of why we decided to focus now
 and build this interface and make it incredibly simple.
 And we will be looking to roll out in these markets in Africa, in the Middle East, in
 Eastern Europe, in Latin America over the coming months.
 Preston Pysh (00:15:40): So Obi, are people able to go onto like an
 Umbral?
 If you're running a full node and you're using the Umbral software, are they able to download
 Fedi on that?
 Or is this specifically for a smartphone, like an iPhone or an Android device?
 Walk us through the software.
 Obi Winnie (00:16:05): Great question.
 So remember, there's two things.
 There's the people who are running the Federation of Guardians, or the Fedite Knights almost.
 And there's the people who are using this app that we're creating, which we're calling
 Fedite.
 And that's a mobile app.
 You download it from Google Store or Apple Store, and you have the app.
 So if you take a Fedimint Federation and the users, let's say it's a village and there's
 500 users, and there's six people in the Federation, the six people in the Federation are the only
 ones who need to download a Bitcoin full node and a Fedimint software.
 We're looking to implement it on things like Noddle, on Raspi Blitz, on Umbral.
 So it's easy to install if you can get the whole shebang and you get the set top or the
 actual device, you can do that.
 If you can't get one of those devices delivered to you because of import restrictions or whatever,
 but you have the beauty of Bitcoin is it's highly decentralized.
 It doesn't need a lot of hardware like others, other blockchains.
 So you've got an old computer, 15-year-old computer, so on.
 These exist everywhere in the world.
 You just need to add a hard drive, which is a terabyte in size.
 You get those for $40, $50 now, and that's enough to run a full node.
 You can then download the Noddle software or the Umbral software and use that instead.
 You also don't need...
 The people running the Federation don't need to be in the same place as the people in...
 They need to be the same place from a relationship point of view.
 They need to have close contact.
 They don't need to be physically in the same place.
 So for example, members of the diaspora who are sending regularly large parts of their
 paychecks back to their friends and family in the global South are ideal candidates for
 running guardians because they are in the West.
 They're already giving money to these people.
 So if they're giving money to them, they're not likely going to want to steal the money
 that they've just given to the people they're protecting.
 They could, for example, buy a Noddle or buy an Umbral or set up a Raspberry Blitz and
 create a Federation amongst themselves for all of their family back home.
 And the family back home just needs to download a piece of software, scan a QR code, and they're
 signed up.
 Knowing that these people...
 Unreal.
 Knowing that these people...
 Yeah.
 Unreal.
 Obi, I know you're active on Twitter.
 So we'll have a link in the show notes to your Twitter profile.
 If people have questions coming out of this interview, I'm sure you're going to get a
 lot of questions.
 Give us a handoff to websites.
 I know there's the Fediment.org website.
 Is there any other websites that you want to highlight or timelines for various things
 that you guys are going to be rolling out?
 Thank you very much for that.
 So first of all, if you want to find out about the base protocol that this is this sort of
 third pillar of the Bitcoin open source ecosystem, go to Fediment.org and that's F-E-D-I-M-I-N-T.org,
 Fediment.org.
 If you want to find out about the new mobile app that we're producing, we've got a site
 and that's Fedi.XYZ.
 So F-E-D-I-.XYZ.
 It's as simple as that.
 And then if you want to find out about my...
 We have Fediment on Twitter.
 If you want to follow Fediment on Twitter, there's a Telegram group called Fediment as
 well, which is very active and that's really interesting conversations.
 And then finally, if you want to hear my musings on Twitter, my occasional musings, you can
 find me @Obi on Twitter.
 So just Obi.
 I was a very early Twitter user.
 So that's my Twitter handle.
 That's hard to get Obi.
 That's really hard to get.
 Yeah, it's a very...
 It's a three letter Twitter handle.
 Yeah, it's very hard to get.
 And I bet you Disney would love to own that handle, by the way.
 I get lots of offers, but I'm comfortable keeping Obi, the Obi one.
 So in other words, anyone who's interested, buzz off.
 Yeah, I think they've given up many years ago.
 I'll tell you, what a pleasure.
 What a pleasure talking with you, sir.
 Thank you for your time.
 I learned a ton.
 I am so excited about what this means moving forward.
 And I have no doubt that what you're building is going to be a game changer and something
 revolutionary to add to this revolutionary technology and can't thank you enough for
 coming on the show today, Obi.
 Thank you very much.
 It's been a pleasure talking to you.
 I really enjoyed it.
 I think you have...
 Well, I personally think you have this incredible energy.
 It's really enjoyable talking to you.
 You would be the ideal person as a guardian.
 I appreciate that.
 I would be very comfortable being part of a guardian group that I would be using for
 many reasons.
 Likewise, sir.
 Likewise.
 All right.
 Thank you very much.
 Well, thank you for your time, Obi.
 See you later.
