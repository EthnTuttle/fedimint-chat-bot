 Welcome back to Bitcoin Builders.
 This is the show about Bitcoin's entrepreneurial renaissance, and today we have an exemplary
 model of exactly that.
 Obi Nwasu is the CEO of fedi.
 fedi is a new protocol for federated community custody and usage of Bitcoin.
 It is a scaling solution, but it's more than that as well.
 It's a new way to think about how Bitcoin is used among communities of trust that could
 scale Bitcoin to its next billion users.
 This is an amazing conversation about where fedi came from and what it's trying to do,
 and I know you're going to enjoy it.
 Bitcoin Builders is brought to you by InWolf's Clothing.
 Wolf is the first startup accelerator dedicated entirely to Bitcoin and lightning startups.
 Check them out at wolfnyc.com.
 It's Saturday, May 27th.
 This is Bitcoin Builders.
 Let's go.
 All right, Obi, welcome to Bitcoin Builders.
 How are you doing, sir?
 I'm very good.
 Thank you for having me.
 Yeah, no, I'm super excited to have this conversation.
 I think there's a lot of great stuff to talk about.
 But for those who aren't familiar with you, tell me a little bit about yourself and maybe
 how you came to Bitcoin.
 So my name is Obi Nwasu.
 I am the CEO and co-founder of fedi, which exists to accelerate adoption of Bitcoin, of
 lightning, of Fedimint, and all of the Bitcoin and lightning and Fedimint ecosystem that's
 going to be built on top of Fedimint and on top of lightning, to the point where we aim
 to have hundreds of millions and billions of users getting into Bitcoin and lightning
 and Fedimint over the coming years.
 But prior to that, I was born in the UK, conceived in Nigeria.
 I call myself an Anglo-Jurian.
 And I grew up in inner city, central London.
 I had an instant interest in computers and AI.
 So I was building neural networks in secondary school, studied computer science and cognitive
 science in University College London, and then went on to the first part of my adult
 career was in various dotcoms and in the UK and European sector.
 But some of them went on to be incredibly successful.
 Dotcom one, dotcom two, I was involved in building 30 million user, massive multiplayer
 virtual worlds and all this other stuff.
 And then I came to Bitcoin and I first got into Bitcoin in 2011.
 A number of people sent me the white paper saying that this was right up your street.
 You're a geek, Obi, so you'll love the tech, but also you're into the fact that the world
 was not meritocratic.
 It didn't surface to best people.
 And you always go on about that.
 And you've got this world's first meritocratic money, which so you would find this very interesting.
 And I did.
 Two years later, I set up the UK's longest, went on to become the UK's longest running
 Bitcoin exchange with my co-founders.
 Started in 2013, sold in 2021.
 And a big part of the sale was my concern that we were heading into this world where
 people were either a select few, either going to self custody because they had the financial,
 technical and philosophical strength to be able to do it.
 And then the remaining 90, 95% were going to have their money held in one or two highly
 centralized third party custodians like exchanges.
 And I didn't think that was a good end state to be in where, you know, three or four companies
 were holding billions of users accounts and having full oversight and control of them,
 which is far worse than any country that exists today and a few sovereign individuals.
 So we needed a way of getting people off exchanges.
 And I started looking for that.
 That led me to finding my co-founders who are incredible people and we formed the FediMint
 Protocol.
 And a few months after that, we formed Fedi.
 Amazing.
 Tons to dig into.
 You know, I particularly want to put a pin in and come back to this massive space between
 full sort of self-sovereign, self-custody ideals on the one end of the spectrum and
 leaving it with Coinbase on the other.
 But first, let's talk a little bit about, I guess, the FediMint Protocol and then the
 specific implementation or Fedi, which you're building on top of it.
 So what is FediMint?
 So FediMint, we have our new range of t-shirt here, which shows the, this is it, this is
 the initial sort of the main loop that effectively that FediMint goes through.
 And actually, I think it shows in code quite clearly.
 It's this federated application server or another way to think about it at high level
 is this community custody protocol.
 It allows you to set up what we call federations, which are systems set to support a group of
 people, whether there's a family, a company, a community, or any organization.
 So it allows us to set these federations up.
 They are run by a subset of the community, a trusted subset, we call them guardians.
 And then these, and what they do is they are effectively running this software the same
 way they run a Bitcoin node, once it's set up and run, their main job is to not touch
 it and keep it fed and watered with electricity and internet.
 So they are just guarding the box and not touching the box.
 Now beyond custody, it can also provide a number of, three other main pieces of functionality.
 One it provides privacy and scalability using this incredible protocol called Chameleon
 eCash and the benefits of that.
 It provides layer free scaling beyond lightning and beyond Bitcoin, but also increased privacy.
 And two, the platform can be extended with any other functionality you may want as well.
 So it has extensibility.
 You might consider this smart contracting and so on, but it's far more powerful than
 what you would normally consider from a smart contract.
 And this is all run on behalf of a community.
 And when I say community, that can be a village, it can be a town, it can be a church group,
 or it could be a large family, or it could be a company or any other organization of
 grouping of people.
 So you're effectively allowing people and to set up a federation can take minutes to
 make their own scaling layer for the purposes of their own community for Bitcoin and lightning.
 And they can scale it functionally, scale it in terms of privacy and scale it in terms
 of transaction throughput.
 So the end result is that we see a future where there's hundreds of thousands of these
 federations, think of them as cities.
 And within those cities, you'll be able to do complex functionality and store both money
 and data.
 So you can do transactions with your money and with your data, you can scale without
 taking up bandwidth on a Bitcoin and lightning network.
 And then all of these cities will be seamlessly connected with the lightning network.
 So you think the lightning network is your motorway network connecting these cities together.
 And people obviously will have, there'll be spur roads connecting to people's own private
 roads and their own private mansion.
 These will be the self custodian, people are self custodian, you have the resources to
 be able to self custody, even in a future where, again, at scale, when you think of
 billions of users, it will be a future where on chain transaction fees.
 And even if those are on chain transactions are for channel rebalancing on the lightning
 network could be quite high.
 It may be 10s if not hundreds of dollars per transaction.
 And at that future, it makes sense to have these ways of effectively grouping up many,
 many hundreds of thousands of transactions and users together.
 So those on chain costs can be amortized across them.
 And that allows you to scale to billions of users.
 So within these communities, within these federations, these aren't necessarily just
 communities of hodlers, right, where it's a custody solution.
 These are also people who are transacting with each other.
 And that's sort of where that scalability comes from, is that within that federation,
 they can transact before it sort of resolves, you know, back to the to the main chain.
 Exactly.
 Within communities, they can transact with each other, with both money and data, they
 can share information with each other.
 So for example, there can be multiple viewers or ways to interface with a community.
 We have as a company, Fedi Alpha, which is an app which allows you to view this in the
 same way as the internet can have multiple web browsers that can view it.
 And there's Chrome and Safari and so on.
 We are the first viewer of an organizer of the federations that a user is connected to
 with Fedi Alpha.
 But within that, we have obviously a wallet which allows you to see your balances, i.e.
 gold or Bitcoin and transfer it from one person to another.
 If they're outside of the network, it will seamlessly make that a Lightning transaction.
 But if it's internal, it will still look like a Lightning transaction.
 But behind the scenes, it will be an E-cash transaction, which won't take up any bandwidth
 on the Lightning network.
 And in theory, you could do as you would find most transactions people do are within their
 own community.
 If you think about it, accommodation, transport, food, consumables, these are local payments
 for most people.
 They don't ship in their consumables every month from the other side of the world.
 They get them locally.
 So this 80% plus, I would guess, of payments could happen within a federation without any
 load on the Lightning network or the Bitcoin network.
 And when you need to buy something, for example, buying something from Amazon or online or
 Netflix or whatever it may be, that is a remote payment that would seamlessly go out.
 over the Lightning Network, and there'll still be a second or so
 and cost you a fraction of a penny.
 But it's not just money, it's also data.
 So within, for example, the federations that Fedi suggests people install
 include a chat service within them,
 so that people can communicate within the federation,
 not with being sure that they're not being viewed
 by some central organization in the offices of Signal or WhatsApp
 or Telegram or WeChat.
 In the federation, communications with other people within that same federation
 are hosted by the federation as well.
 You could run your own NOSTA node, for example,
 or even a federated NOSTA node within your own federation,
 so that any costs for storage and caching of data
 for the purposes of using, for example, social media communication
 would be amortized across the federation and be much lower cost
 because you're not running your own NOSTA node, it's shared between you.
 That could also be a revenue source for the community
 because then you could provide it to third parties.
 And if you're charging a fee, that would accrue to the federation,
 which could be released as a benefit to consumers.
 So it's money and data.
 If we're going to this decentralized world,
 that is a world of decentralized servers running different processes,
 whether it's data with IPFS,
 whether it's store and forwarding discovery with NOSTA,
 whether it's chat with Matrix or XMPP,
 or whether it's money with Bitcoin Lightning and FedEmit.
 All of that can be run in a federated manner
 without a single point of trust within a federation.
 It almost seems like where the genesis of this was,
 or at least the genesis of wanting to leave the exchange
 and think about this set of problems,
 was this question of custody
 and how to get more people into a custody mode.
 But it seems like the end result of the explorations that that started
 was much more of a zooming out to a future
 that was actually enabled for decentralization
 rather than just theoretically interested in decentralization.
 That is an incredibly good and accurate insight.
 So what happened is you have two or three different forces
 or different ones.
 So you had Justin, who's really interested in community
 and a return to community values and so on,
 and this is something he'd been looking for.
 And then you had Eric,
 who was very interested in this incredible protocol,
 Charmy and Ekesh.
 And it's been around, this year will be his 40th anniversary,
 but it had a weakness which required a single point of trust.
 And then you had me, who was looking at ways
 of how can I get people off exchanges,
 having tried for many, many, many years
 so that they weren't custodying with,
 I call it stranger custody versus do-it-yourself custody.
 We needed getting away from stranger custody
 because I always like to say,
 if you give your money to a curly-haired guy in the Bahamas,
 it may not end well.
 And so we had these different interests
 and through this fortuitous connecting,
 we realized that this Fediment protocol,
 which Eric invented,
 and it used this idea of federations,
 which was popularized by Blockstream.
 And Blockstream were one of the first
 to see the potential of Fediment, in fact,
 and they were the first to sort of sponsor
 the open-source protocol,
 I think well over a year before I became aware of it
 and support Eric's work on this.
 He created this as a solution to the problem
 of how do I federate the Xiaomi and Mint
 so that there's no single point of trust.
 But when I saw it, that solution implicitly
 also had a custom,
 allowed you to federate custody as well,
 but still provide a user experience,
 which could potentially,
 the product didn't exist in terms of UX,
 but I could envision it potentially
 could be incredibly simple.
 And then it became clear that who would you,
 who would be the best sort of sets
 to be able to actually act as guardians and for whom?
 And it made sense that within communities,
 whether those be companies or organizations or villages,
 that that made most sense.
 And then they had their existing mechanisms
 to identify the most trusted elements.
 Within a company, it's likely, hopefully,
 the C-level suite, for example,
 or the finance department.
 If you can't trust them in money,
 then you've got bigger problems, for example.
 With a community, for example,
 then it might be the diaspora,
 people who regularly send money home to their family,
 large parts of their paycheck,
 are probably good people to custody the money
 'cause they're the ones sending the money
 in the first place, for example.
 But they all will have existing mechanisms
 to identify those,
 as opposed to giving it a stranger
 who's incentivized by money to custody your money.
 There's a different second-party federated trust model.
 But once you realize that what he built
 was this general engine to take any service
 and function that would be better
 if there was no single point of trust
 and run it in this federated manner,
 you realize this is like a federated operating system.
 As you say, an operating system handles custody of data,
 some sort of file manager,
 and then an execution environment
 to execute apps that use that data.
 This is what FedEmin can do,
 but in a federated manner
 where there is no single point of trust.
 Whereas if I run it on my phone or my desktop
 or on the internet,
 there is always a single point of trust and control,
 but it can do the same thing,
 but for the subset,
 and that's a large subset of things
 that you want to run without a single point of trust.
 If you're running Grand Theft Auto or Pac-Man,
 you probably don't care about it
 running in a federated manner.
 If it fails, you just restart the game.
 But for money, for passwords,
 what should I store it with LastPass,
 or should I store it amongst my community, for example,
 and have my community help me recover?
 Or for certain sensitive data,
 you know, certain information that you,
 some things, you know,
 general pictures that you screenshotted off the internet
 and so on, it could be stored anywhere.
 But pictures of loved ones,
 maybe I want that stored in a federated manner
 because I want to, if one machine failed,
 I still want to be able to recover it, et cetera, et cetera.
 - You know, it's interesting.
 When you kind of take a step back
 and abstract it away from Bitcoin
 or any specific one specific use case,
 you almost are left with this just filling in
 what becomes or sort of appears to be
 a pretty obvious gap, right?
 So if you look at human kind of models
 that exist in the world across different domains,
 you have a market mechanism, right?
 You trust a third party to do something for you
 because you're giving them money
 and it's in their incentive to not screw up
 whatever it is they're promising
 because they want you to keep giving them money
 and other people like you to keep giving them money.
 So that's one model.
 Another model is you just trust yourself,
 but there's this sort of whole massive space in between
 that sort of falls along the actual kind of majority
 of how humans organize themselves,
 which is into groups based on kinship, affiliation,
 affinity, interest, activity.
 And so I think mapping some of these activities
 onto that existing modality of human organization
 on an intuitive level just makes sense,
 almost in a way that you kind of can't believe
 that it doesn't exist yet until you start digging into it.
 - Again, it's an incredibly succinct,
 you have a propensity, I say,
 why, I have some sort of propensity,
 why use one word when a hundred will do
 and you're the other way around.
 (laughing)
 And he goes, I could simplify,
 but I just don't have the time to do that.
 But I think that's it.
 There is this market mechanism
 and that makes sense for a large set
 of very important use cases.
 Then there is this idea, self-sufficiency,
 and that makes sense for certain use cases.
 But one of humanity's superpowers
 is to be able to form complex groups and societies.
 And if you look in the animal kingdom,
 really humans, termites and bees
 are the only, literally the only things that can do this.
 But we have the other added benefit
 of some reasonable level of intelligence
 over ants and termites, I believe.
 And also we have the ability
 to have fine grain control over the world
 with opposable thumbs and so on.
 So we can manipulate the world to a fine degree.
 I mean, ants basically can have to manipulate
 the entire world with their mouth.
 And we can also think at quite level,
 quite high degrees of intelligence about the world.
 Plus we have this ability to form very complex society.
 And so what we like to say is that
 FEDI as an organization wants to combine
 the most fundamental human technology.
 And that's the technology of community.
 We see it as a technology.
 And then combine that with empowering
 and freedom technologies like Bitcoin,
 like Lightning, like Fediman,
 and all of the other Bitcoin and Lightning ecosystems
 that's out there and beyond,
 the decentralized ecosystem,
 whether that be, as I say, Nostar and so on,
 and brings them together to level up humanity.
 And if you see every system that's grown,
 it always has this structure where
 there is another scenario where if you have shared interests,
 it makes sense to organize because it's win-win.
 It's like, you know, Nash equilibrium.
 It's the win-win scenario where
 there is sometimes beneficial to be part of a group
 because it benefits you while benefiting others.
 We see it in, we don't have everybody,
 if you put it into a physical context,
 everybody in the world doesn't have their own private road.
 the world would be all road.
 So you form into cities and connected by major roads.
 And that's how we scale to billions.
 If you look at the internet, we have IP version four.
 We've discussed other standards which could extend,
 but it's works, it's reliable, it's consistent.
 It's been around for a long time.
 And we then use these,
 we then take a few of these IP addresses
 because there's not enough IP addresses
 for every computer or system in the world by far.
 We're way, all of them actually below.
 But what we can do is we can take a few of those addresses
 and we can give them to an organization
 or an individual or a company or a community.
 And then they can create a number of virtual addresses
 for their community.
 And then they have this network address translation,
 a NAT to convert between the public address on the internet
 and the addresses allocated to their community,
 whether it's a hosting provider, a company or so on.
 So in that context, you can think of Fed,
 again, that's the equivalent within a community,
 that's your city.
 And then IP is, IPv4 is the way you send information
 from city to city or company to company
 or hosting provider to hosting provider.
 So again, we've scaled this system
 that's reliable, consistent,
 but it has its limitations
 to support billions of IP addresses.
 And it's a very similar equivalent in both cases
 to federations being the equivalent
 of the hosting providers
 and network address translation,
 allowing you to access this.
 And IPv4 is the lightning network
 connecting these communities together.
 You can have your own,
 if you want the infrastructure and setup and the cost,
 you can have your own direct static IPs
 directly on IPv4 addresses.
 But most people don't need that
 and are comfortable having a provider.
 And if they're worried about the risk,
 they connect to multiple providers.
 They connect to the internet through their home
 and their mobile phone
 and potentially from a wifi network as well
 when they go into an office, et cetera.
 And in combination,
 that gives them that access and redundancy.
 And it's the same when you use something like Fedi,
 you can connect to multiple federations
 and you can choose, pick and choose what money
 and what data and what parts of your digital life
 you use on each.
 You get this one combined view in one place.
 - So there are tons of different types of communities
 as you've articulated.
 When you guys think about where you think early use case
 or sort of the most important use case for this is,
 what types of communities are you imagining
 or maybe even what types of communities
 were you designing for with in mind?
 - So when we started,
 the idea was we should just build this technology
 for communities.
 I was looking at getting people off exchanges
 into their own existing communities
 and different people had different ideas of that.
 Then last year I was invited after,
 and I talk a bit with Miami
 and Eric also did the talk, it's quite funny.
 It was with Eric and Casey.
 And we were explaining in this future
 when on-chain fees are really high,
 you're gonna need this.
 And then Casey, and he was telling us
 about this sort of art project he was working on
 where he wants to enumerate every Satoshi on the internet.
 We're like, it's interesting,
 but we're focused on Fedi Mint.
 A year later, he's provided us a sort of a sneak peek
 into a future of high fees.
 - Yeah, right.
 - Which is quite interesting.
 But I was then invited by Alex Gleistin
 to speak at Oslo Freedom Forum.
 And we're going again to speak again in a few weeks time.
 And there was the first time I went
 and I met some of the most inspiring people I've ever met.
 And it's changed my life.
 They were human rights defenders, activists,
 people who were running NGOs
 or responsible for giving aid into many parts of the world.
 More often than not in the global South,
 but all of them, a part of the world
 which are under the yoke of authority regimes
 and dictatorships.
 If you take the part of the world
 that doesn't have some form of democracy,
 that's the majority of the world that doesn't have that.
 If you also take the part of the world
 that's in the global South,
 that's also the majority of humans in the world.
 And if you combine those two groups together,
 you're talking about 70, 75% of the world.
 We in the West,
 with some sort of whatever you call it,
 functioning democracy,
 who are not on the bottom half in terms of wealth,
 we are the edge case of the edge case here.
 And these people, they're not Bitcoiners,
 they're definitely not crypto,
 they're just people who are effectively
 the ultimate guardians of their communities.
 That's what I realized.
 They, some of them have gone to prison for years
 for supporting their communities
 or being tortured or had family and friends murdered.
 And very often at the show,
 and it's quite a common thing apparently,
 they will talk about people
 who the last year were speaking
 and this year are now dead
 because they continued through bravery to support.
 So these people raise millions,
 some cases billions for these communities
 and they sacrifice and they focus their life for them.
 So yes, in theory,
 when I have philosophical discussions
 about they could run off with the money,
 yes, maybe, but on a list of spectrum,
 I prefer if I'm a member of their community,
 they've been devoting themselves
 and also ASP a quorum of them have all of a sudden
 change the behavior of a lifestyle, lifedime.
 I would much prefer as a member of the community
 they were supporting to be having them as my guardians
 as opposed to a stranger.
 And that was something that hit me
 and also realized that the challenges
 that they were facing could not be serviced,
 especially the scale they wanted to deal with,
 with any other solution other than FediMint.
 You could not in many of these regions
 give people individual hardware wallets.
 You might send a thousand hardware wallets
 and 10 might make it to the actual destination.
 And also then you'll have to secure it.
 You'll have to find ways where people
 who may not even be able to read or so on
 can easily recover their keys
 in the event that they lost their information.
 And there are many other problems
 which if you are sophisticated enough
 and you have the financial means to do it,
 you should definitely do it.
 But realistically, these guys or girls
 were not going to be able to do it.
 So having realized that and having realized
 that FediMint was a missing piece,
 Lightning was key, Bitcoin was key,
 other systems of organization, for example,
 decentralized conversation and chat and discovery
 were key to this.
 And having realized that FediMint was a missing piece,
 I came back from Oslo, a changed person.
 I talked to Justin and Eric
 who went on to become my co-founders.
 We were already working together,
 saw this as a great technology,
 but for me, I'd run an exchange in the UK,
 a successful exchange,
 and I'd been in Bitcoin since 2011.
 I didn't need to work
 and I was going to take a three-year break,
 you know, just chill for a bit.
 And I realized, okay, for three or four months,
 that's enough, I've got to go back in
 because this has to be done.
 It was very clear.
 I talked to the guys and I'm thankful to this day
 that they weren't there.
 They didn't go through this cathartic point.
 They did sometime later,
 having met up with these brave men and women,
 but they trusted, they could see the fervor,
 they could see, and they knew that the technology
 was a great technology, so we decided
 we needed a commercial vehicle to accelerate this
 and make this happen.
 So they were the first community
 that we really could see an incredible fit.
 It's for everybody, everywhere,
 and we've had interest from corporates and so on,
 but this was the thing that really galvanized us
 and made us decide we're going to, you know,
 hit the ground running and build a company.
 And that was less than 12 months ago,
 and 12 months later, we've raised 21.21 million
 from incredible investors who share the mission and vision.
 We've had amazing support from the Bitcoin community,
 amazing support from people supporting the FedEmit protocol,
 and we're not going to stop until billions of people
 are using Bitcoin and Lightning
 and other freedom-preserving systems.
 - Amazing.
 I could take us on a unbelievably long detour into this.
 I started my career thinking I was going to do
 post-conflict reconciliation.
 - Oh my God.
 - In the Middle East and East Africa, so.
 - Oh my days.
 - So one of the, I guess, validating things
 is one of the experiences that I had
 that really took a lot for me to learn and understand
 and just come to recognize something was,
 so I was in Northern Uganda,
 and this was like 2006, 2007, 2008.
 So the Lord's Resistance Army was starting to peter off.
 You remember the, there's that big movement in the US,
 which I'm blanking on the name of now,
 but like the Joseph Kony organization
 and all this sort of stuff that they were,
 like, there's a lot of discussion around, you know,
 genocide and all these sort of things
 happening in the US at that time.
 And so I was in Northern Uganda
 that had been most affected by the Lord's Resistance Army.
 And this group, this LRA group had been abducting kids
 and turning them into child soldiers
 for like 10 or 20 years at that point.
 And the way that reintegration happened was,
 there was a traditional ceremony called Mato Oput,
 which was, it meant drinking the bitter herb.
 And it was a traditional ceremony that had been used
 totally different things but had been retrofitted by this group of northern Ugandans for
 for the sake of reintegrating people basically who had escaped or who had been captured from
 the Lords of Citizens Army. And it was so hard for me to understand how, through this
 one ceremony, this community could just forgive these people who had committed such atrocities.
 And it really took just like sitting and listening and sitting and listening and sitting and
 listening. And what it came down to was, this was a model of reconciliation that came from
 this community. That was, they had figured out how to connect something from their past
 that was tradition to a new and important use case for community forgiveness. And one
 of the challenges of international aid is often that people who think that they are
 coming in to make a difference or do good still impose a set of values or presumptions
 upon people, even with good intentions. And this was a way that this community was reasserting
 power in a traditional way. And it didn't matter that to an outsider who had a different
 sense of justice, it was hard for me to imagine. What mattered is that it was natively from
 the community. And the reason that I was thinking about it as you were talking is that all over
 the world, and it's not just villages who have gone through conflict that have these
 sort of norms and mores and stuff, communities have developed their own ways of dealing with
 things, their own power structures, their own sense of how trust flows. And it's not
 that it's perfect, they're constantly in flux and dynamic, but they exist. And so layering
 a technology that is designed to plug into whatever that set of community norms and trust
 norms is, it makes a very intuitive sense to me. Again, hearkening back to that.
 It's exactly that. I have been asked by people I know who are, let's say, in the altcoin
 space, like, what's the governance model? And I go, well, the governance model is whatever
 each community decides. I mean, people have ways of making decisions. They didn't just
 sit there making no decisions until we came along. And it's likely for different social
 reasons and structural reasons that if you go to 1000 different communities, companies,
 organizations, they're going to have 1000 different ways, sometimes nuanced, different,
 sometimes drastically different ways of running that work for them. And for us to come in
 and say, well, we've got this one size fits all governance model for the entire, every
 community everywhere is, there's a level of arrogance there, which is sort of, well, I
 think it's pretty extreme. And so what we do is we are taking community and understanding
 as a technology, a very powerful technology that's led to the modern world in great part.
 So has capitalism, so is self-reliance, but these are all key parts. And we're just taking
 what you do and turbocharging it. So we like to say we empower communities everywhere.
 So we just allow you to put nitrous on what you already do by providing these tools. But
 it is there, for example, in many parts of the world, there are community savings and
 loan systems, there's Saco in Kenya, there's, there's many, it's very common, especially,
 again, in parts of the world where you have no banking options, that they're, but they're
 so minimal, or so expensive, they're not economically viable for you to access. So that's the have
 no banking options, for example, or parts of the world where you have actually pretty
 good banking options, but you can't trust them. So if you're living under an authoritarian
 regime, and because of the travel rule, if you receive money from an aid agency, that's
 opposing the state, they will have to say the source of funds, it goes to your bank
 account. For example, in Belarus is an example of that great banking there, you get arrested,
 or you get tortured or imprisoned because you've received money from a source that the
 government doesn't like. And surprise, surprise, the government has a direct hotline with all
 the banking institutions, the independent banking institutions. So that's another part
 of the world where you cannot trust your banking options, even if they're good. These are parts
 of the world that equal the majority of the world, either you don't have good bank options,
 or you cannot trust the bank options you have to a greater or lesser extent. In those scenarios,
 people need to find an alternative way. They weren't Bitcoiners, they weren't thinking
 about money, they're thinking about helping their community, because a stronger community
 is better for everybody, including themselves, because they understand there's an aligned
 interest of a stronger, powerful community. And they come to Bitcoin, after trying other
 things. Some of these people are sending in cash, bags of cash, and because of bribes
 and so on the way, 60% of it doesn't make it to target. Some of it, you know, as an
 alternative. So if there are ways where Bitcoin is an asset that, for example, people are,
 if you're savvy, and in the local market, you will understand its long term performance,
 and its greater ability in the global to be used to buy goods or services in a global
 context. So you, there's always a significant subset of people in pretty much every market
 and country worldwide, who's willing to accept Bitcoin in exchange for local currency, which
 doesn't have those properties. So if you can give someone Bitcoin, they only need to find
 one or two of those other people. And there's a ready market of people who take the Bitcoin
 that you've received from friends, family, from aid agencies, and convert it into local
 currency. So it gives you access to this, this, this global resource, which also has
 the added benefit of being the most regulatory clear by country mile of any other assets.
 And it has all these properties, it has built in support for multi signature support, most
 signature custody, which is a very powerful concept. Up until the invention of Bitcoin,
 it was not possible for multiple people to own an asset at the same time, it just wasn't
 possible. You could both all be holding on to it at the same time, and because then argue
 that we're all owning it, but that's not very practical. And so that's enabled that possibility
 again, which allows you to decentralize and federate trust even further. So it's an incredible
 asset combined with communities needs in these parts of the world. It's a match made in heaven.
 And we built technology to allow that to to be as simple as possible.
 On the theme of the technology, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the approach
 that you guys take to social recovery. So bringing this sort of, you know, this community
 trust layer to custody of assets. And I think the context that we should have in mind as
 we're as we're having this discussion is, obviously, the last two weeks have seen the
 Bitcoin and crypto world more broadly have a lot of discussions of social recovery mechanisms
 of the space between custodial and non custodial, the sort of ledger introduced their own sort
 of ledger recover program, which, you know, if we if we take them at face value, sort
 of the intention was to create space between full self custody and, and sort of, you know,
 fully custodial options for a new set of people, but it had not gone over well, you know, probably
 having to do with not just the model, but how it did or didn't sort of interact with
 what their sort of brand promises has been before. But I would love to hear more about
 about your sort of approach to social recovery and how you guys think about it. And then
 maybe we can expand it out to the broader context.
 Yeah, no, I mean, it kind of it didn't escape our attention as well, or my attention. But
 so you've got first party custody, and let's do it yourself. If you can do that, it's the
 best. And if you are going to do that, it does make sense. I mean, there are limitations
 to hardware wallets as well that can be pointed out. But for most people, just from a pragmatic
 point of view, self custody through hardware wallets, is if you're going to do it, you
 should do it that way. You then have third party custody, where you're literally giving
 everything to one stranger, whether it's an organization or an individual, and hoping
 that they give it back to you later. What we have in the middle is this form of federated,
 i.e. multiple, multiple people, second party custody, community, company, the company that
 you're part of that is organizational custody. Now, one of the you still have access to a
 certain amount of capital in that context. And that's stored on your phone, or your device
 in the form of e cash is like eBTC versus lightning BTC, for example. And you still
 want to deal with the issue of what happens if I lose my phone, my phone gets wiped, etc.
 How can I recover these? Now, you can back it up using a seed, a 12 word seed, and that
 option is there. And that's the normal option. But then the challenges were where do I store
 my 12 word seed. And if I'm in a depending on where I am, I may be in a part of the world
 where my house is not particularly secure, I can't just stick it underneath in my safe,
 you know, it doesn't give me guarantees, or I cannot afford sticking in bank vaults or
 having those options. So how do I secure it? The idea then is you need some way of backing
 it up and storing with different people. Well, you need to find people that you can trust
 that are reliable, that you can contact 24 seven to help you recover that and ideally,
 you will know you already. So therefore, you don't have to give them any KYC information
 because they've seen better than KYC, they have KYF know your friend know your family,
 they've just known you over a period of time. So they know who you are, you know, they just
 and even if they're not friends or family, they're part of the same community, they just
 from their lived in experience.
 There's the KYF happened over time.
 Now, when you think about that
 and the extensibility of federations,
 why not have the Federation Guardians
 do that for you automatically?
 And again, it's not the Federation Guardians,
 it's the Federation Guardians,
 FedEvent servers are doing it for you.
 They're just guarding the machines
 and this is in the main handled automatically.
 So even if they're not around,
 they will still be able to recover
 as long as the machines are online and connected.
 And so one of the first FedEvent modules,
 this is modules are,
 think of them as application or apps,
 ways to extend the functionality of the FedEvent.
 You extend your mobile phone with mobile apps,
 websites with web apps,
 and or websites and computers with,
 desktop computers with applications
 with FedEvent modules.
 So the first module that we as FedEvent, sorry,
 added was the social backup module.
 And this is an, again, it's an optional service,
 but what it allows a user to do is to click a button,
 take their private key,
 encrypt it within their phone,
 shard it, break it up into chunks.
 Let's say there are seven guardians, seven chunks,
 and then give the seven chunks to each one of those guardians
 but encrypted.
 So even if they put them together,
 they wouldn't be able to reconstruct it
 without it being sent back to the user.
 On top of that, we provide a way of proving
 that the user who sent the tag in the first place
 is the same as the user who's recovering it
 without revealing any additional information
 to the guardians.
 The way we do that is we ask the user to make
 a three second video where they say the word FedE.
 They just say the word FedE and that's it.
 That video is then hashed.
 And the hash of that video,
 which is basically we take a fingerprint of that video
 and that fingerprint of that video is then used to tag,
 so a hashtag against each one of the shards and that shared.
 So the guardians still have no way of reconstructing it
 because it's encrypted and have no way of knowing
 who it's for because they only have a hash to identify it.
 So you know it belongs to whoever's video
 matches this hash, but they don't know who it is.
 You as the user are left with the video,
 which is your proof that you're the one
 who recorded this in the first place.
 And the encryption key that was used to encrypt.
 That's put together in a file called backup.fede.
 And then we encourage you to save that file
 in multiple places because the security requirements
 are a lot lower.
 It doesn't actually contain the password.
 It's just the video to show that you access the password
 and the decryption key.
 So you can share it with yourself on WhatsApp or on a Slack,
 or you can send it an email to yourself,
 or you can send it to a few friends,
 as long as it's not the guardians who you know who they are.
 It can be anyone else,
 the other 8 billion people on the planet,
 just not the guardians.
 Now, when you come to recover,
 you will find one of those backups that you've made
 and you'll click on it.
 Oh, you rejoin the federation, which takes seconds.
 Scanning a QR code is all it takes to join a federation
 because you don't need an email.
 You don't need phone number to join a federation.
 So it's quicker to sign up to a federation
 than to even sign up to WhatsApp or so on
 because no person has the information that's needed.
 You then click to recover
 and you open one of these backups
 that you've stored in multiple places.
 It then opens up, it extracts the image
 and extracts the password,
 and then asks you to contact, in this case,
 five of the seven guardians
 and get them to scan a QR code that it presents on screen.
 You go up to each one, let's say,
 and you can do it over a video call
 or you can do it in person.
 If you're worried about AI and so on,
 you should do it in person, obviously,
 because then that's hard for AI, again.
 So it's AI proof as well, and deep fake proof,
 if you choose to only allow recovery in person,
 until we have Androids that are as good as humans.
 - Yeah.
 - So you then walk up to the person,
 they scan the QR code.
 Only at that point upon scanning
 is that one guardian sent just the video
 where you're saying Fede.
 Now, you are in front of them as well.
 So you're not giving any information more
 than they already see by literally talking to you
 and seeing you,
 because you're not saying your name, age,
 date of birth or anything.
 You're just showing your visage,
 which they see because you're literally talking to them.
 And they're hearing you say one word,
 which they hear because you're talking to them as well.
 And they compare that video against you.
 And if it's you, and likely,
 if they're part of the community,
 they recognize you anyway,
 then they will click OK,
 and they will then send that one shard to you.
 They will only be able to find the shard
 because of the video,
 because they will hash it,
 and then they will finally be able to locate the shard
 that relates to you and send it back to you.
 You do that with the other five,
 and half an hour later,
 you have got enough shards needed
 to recover your private keys.
 Now, the entire process for backup takes 20 seconds.
 And the recovery process is however long it takes you
 to get, let's say it's four guardians,
 three of the four to scan a QR code.
 And for them to click, it's you.
 But you've just done,
 if you look at something,
 there's various guides on best practice backup of 12 words.
 We've just done the best practice backup process
 of sharding it, encrypting it,
 sharing with trusted people,
 and ensuring that the trusted parties
 constantly check their backup regularly.
 That's the other thing.
 Many people take their backup 12 words,
 give it to a friend, one friend, not multiple.
 But then that friend may not be in the regular habit
 of every month checking their backup still available
 and not being eaten by the dog
 or waterlogged or lost or so, you know,
 so that when in four, five, 10 years time
 they need to recover it, they can't find it.
 Again, because this is running
 on the machines of the guardians,
 the FedEmint software is just constantly just checking
 these files that haven't been corrupted.
 And if they have, you can be alerted the day that happens
 and make a new backup,
 not when you actually need it sometime down the line.
 - How have people responded to this approach
 as you've sort of, you know,
 started to get this out there
 and actually, you know, see the community's reaction?
 - The response has been incredibly positive
 because even before this situation
 has been very, very positive
 because people realize,
 especially in these parts of the world
 that we're dealing with,
 that the backup problem is very difficult.
 Also, it made people realize that even now
 when they have first party custody,
 they are actually very often still keeping their backups
 in a second party or third party manner
 and often not federated,
 i.e. they're giving it all to one person.
 And they say, yeah, but it's my wife.
 So I trust them because, well, i.e.
 part of your community.
 You know, you've then just stated
 that you trust your community then.
 And which is, so it helps them realize
 they are implicitly doing second party custody inherently.
 But there's this mental sort of separation
 between one type of second party
 versus another type of second party.
 But really what they're separating is
 the examples they tend to give are untrusted second parties.
 And the examples that they say are different
 are trusted second parties,
 which is why you only store with trusted second parties.
 If you don't feel comfortable,
 then you don't store in the federation.
 And that's a really interesting segue
 as to how the trust is a feature, not a bug.
 Post this announcement, again,
 we've had comments where people see
 the significant difference.
 There is no KYC.
 There's no stranger that you're giving
 and company and organization who has no interest in you
 that you're giving the details to.
 But instead you're giving it by your own choice
 to parties that you know already.
 And again, they don't get anything
 until you wish to recover.
 If you just to back up, you give nothing at all.
 Whereas again, here you preemptively give information.
 That's KYC information.
 Here, you only on the point of recovering,
 give them an image of yourself
 while you're standing in front of them,
 which is an image of yourself.
 So you never give more information.
 They walk away not knowing your name,
 your date of birth, where you're from, your age,
 other than from seeing you in person.
 And also as a side effect, we realized,
 again, there were questions around
 what about defects and so on.
 Well, this approach, again,
 using your community as a technology
 means that you could, if you want to,
 meet in person to recover
 and have that as a requirement
 that all recoveries are in person.
 Again, that's not scalable for a company
 to have offices in every single town and city in the world.
 But for community custody, it's incredibly scalable
 because each time you add a community,
 you have guardians related to it
 who are available within that same community.
 So it is actually feasible to walk up in person
 and therefore be deepfake proof as well.
 And I guess the final point is
 we're not stating a certain security guarantee
 that's implicit by hardware offline wallets
 and then switching to something else.
 You're already trusting these guardians
 with the fundamental asset backing,
 backing the e-cash in the system anyway.
 So you're not changing the security guarantees
 by offering the system
 because you're asking the people
 who are costing your Bitcoin
 to help back up the way to recover your Bitcoin
 versus your self custody, no one is in control.
 And now you're offering a backup
 to a different level of privacy and security.
 - Yeah, no, I mean, it's super interesting.
 the second party sort of trusted,
 existing trusted community model
 makes a lot more sense for a social recovery
 than trying to graph that onto the third party relationship.
 You know, because people kind of,
 I think correctly understand that it's,
 you sort of get into the same area
 that you'd be with non-self custody anyways,
 or, you know, custodial options.
 So, okay, you guys just raised a bunch of money.
 What is next for Fedi?
 - A lot.
 We looked back on the last year,
 and we have done quite a lot in that period of time.
 We've got an incredible team.
 We have launched the first version of Fedi.
 We've done trials in multiple countries
 in two different continents behind the scenes
 for federations and so on,
 and got incredible feedback from that.
 We tried to go to the hardest environments
 and learn from there,
 and just go very humbly in and learn.
 So even in the last six months,
 we made massive change to the product
 based on the initial feedback.
 And we've already received a torrent of feedback
 from the launch of Fedi,
 and that will improve Fedi,
 and we'll relay some of that
 to the FediMint protocol developers as well,
 so they can improve FediMint.
 So the next thing we have is over the next few months,
 we, I'm gonna turn into Steve Ballmer
 and be like developers, developers, developers,
 'cause we're a platform,
 and what was Microsoft DOS without Word and spreadsheets,
 and what was Mac without desktop publishing,
 or even Xbox without Halo?
 You need apps to be built on top of these platforms
 for them to really be powerful
 and suit the myriad demands of different communities
 and companies around the world.
 So we're working with accelerators,
 we're with hackathons,
 we're doing something with Bolt.fun,
 we did something with Bitcoin++,
 both inside the Bitcoin ecosystem and outside.
 And when I say outside, I don't necessarily mean crypto,
 I mean web2,
 because you can build FediMint modules,
 which are built with Rust,
 and they can extend the functionality of FediMint,
 and they can be completely powerful.
 That whole social backup functionality I mentioned
 was a FediMint module, for example.
 It's just, so it just shows you
 how expressive these functionalities can be.
 But you can also do FediMods, which are effectively,
 there's three stages of FediMods.
 Stage one are WebLN sites.
 So WebLN-enabled websites can be integrated seamlessly
 with, to experientially within Fedi.
 Later on, stage two is you can take those WebLN sites,
 and if you wish, and you don't want to handle the hosting,
 you can package them up
 and they could be run within a federation.
 So a federation can do the hosting
 and run it for the federation.
 And then stage three is you can take those FediMods
 and other lower level FediMint modules
 can surface up a user interface, an API,
 which these can access again.
 So you get to a world where anyone
 with the ability to build JavaScript web apps
 can build FediMods.
 And if you look at it right now,
 there are less than a thousand people,
 just 950-odd, who are building open source on Bitcoin
 based on numbers I was in Miami
 for the various Bitcoin events.
 There was a study on.
 If you take the whole of the crypto web-free world,
 there is about 20,000.
 Well, how many people are building JavaScript web apps?
 It's millions and millions.
 So we want to take all of that energy
 that is interested in developing here,
 but doesn't want to learn a new esoteric programming language
 and take 100% of their skill,
 90% of their code base,
 and two or three hours of conversion training.
 And they can be building for the benefit of Bitcoin lightning,
 the Bitcoin ecosystem,
 and all of the people and communities
 that we're trying to support.
 So we want to see hundreds of projects,
 thousands of people developing,
 but directly Weberland-enabled websites to begin with
 and FediMods later on.
 And then the subset of who can go deeper
 can build FediMint modules that can do more advanced stuff.
 So that's what we're going to do for the next few months.
 And that's in advance of a full launch,
 public launch to users later on near the end of the year,
 where we will then have something
 that had several months of feedback
 from around the ecosystem, from builders everywhere.
 Also, we'll have a really strong suite of FediMint modules
 and mods that can meet the myriad requirements,
 whether it's interfacing with your accounting system
 or whether it's adding community savings
 or whatever you need,
 or federating NOSTA, whatever you may need.
 So we can therefore, a community coming and pick,
 just like when I've got an app or a mobile phone or a computer,
 I pick the applications and apps that make sense for my computer,
 the same for a community.
 And then we are going to be growing a big, big part,
 I'll finish on this, of what we do is on the human side.
 So on the ground, the only proven way of rolling out,
 especially in the global South
 and in some of these more difficult regimes,
 is having people on the ground.
 We are looking to hire hundreds of,
 we call it the FedEye order, of FedEye masters, FedEye knights,
 and FedEye ambassadors to locate, educate,
 and inculcate communities around the world.
 We start with the masters, there's one per region.
 We'll have more to report on this,
 but things are going very well.
 And then they will bring on board the knights
 who bring on board the ambassadors.
 The end aim is to have hundreds by the end of,
 actually by the end of next year,
 and many hundreds by the end of 2026.
 And these effectively can be on the ground,
 identifying communities, supporting communities.
 They're like a decentralized genius bar,
 app store genius bar for the Bitcoin community.
 Because federations and fediment are like an operating system,
 and just like an operating system,
 they can't do anything without the machine it runs on,
 without the internet it connects to,
 and without apps running on it.
 The machine it runs on, we need Bitcoin nodes,
 we need people like Umbrella and Startline,
 and that has to be help,
 you have to help communities with that.
 It needs access to the lightning network,
 so we have to decide, do you use
 one of the myriad different providers,
 Voltage, Bolt's Reserver, Zebedee, Breeze, so on.
 We would work with communities to connect these
 in the way that makes sense for them.
 And then you understand what their requirements are
 and say, okay, you need on and off ramping.
 Maybe you're in Nigeria, you can use Bitnob.
 You're in Guatemala, you can use IBEX,
 maybe Neutron Pay, et cetera.
 Or you need community savings,
 well, there's a module that can do that for you and so on.
 And we can help make them aware of all this stuff
 that's out there.
 But they all see it on one app,
 and it's one clear, clean,
 and because of things, protocols,
 WebLN and LNURL auth,
 and the fact that we have a built-in web browser
 within these systems,
 it provides this cohesive, simple experience
 that brings together all of these aspects
 of the Bitcoin ecosystem in one place.
 So that's why we say we win
 by ensuring the entire Bitcoin ecosystem wins.
 - Love it, man.
 This is great stuff.
 I think it just makes so much sense.
 Where can people keep track of the project
 if they're interested?
 - FedE, to keep track of that,
 go to fede.xyz, very simple.
 And for FedE Mint, which is the protocol behind it,
 if you're a hardcore engineer
 and you want to work on that
 or build FedE Mint modules,
 that's fede.org.
 And for myself personally on Twitter,
 I'm @Obi on Twitter.
 I'm also @Obi.
 You can find me on Nostra as well.
 That's it.
 Just keep track, get involved,
 whether you're a community,
 whether you're a builder,
 we would love to talk to you.
 - Appreciate you taking this all about it, man.
 - Thank you, matey.
 - All right, guys, back to NLW here
 for just a super quick wrap up.
 I said this during our conversation,
 but it really does feel like what FedE's tapping into
 is an incredibly normal and obvious mode of human existence
 that happens day in and day out in the world today,
 but which hasn't been mapped
 onto this domain of money quite yet,
 or at least not the domain of digital money.
 People operate not just individually
 and not just with third-party services
 that provide them tools and resources for money,
 but in the context of communities and groups.
 Humans are social animals,
 and we organize our lives
 around the different groups we participate in,
 whether it's teams or our families or our friend groups
 or our work or our school.
 When you view the world through that lens,
 the question becomes why isn't digital money programmed
 for that type of experience?
 It's obviously too early to know
 whether the exact approach that FedE's taking
 is the right fit for those groups,
 or even exactly what those groups' money needs are.
 But in a world where everything is up for grabs
 in terms of how we organize ourselves
 and what the structures of the societies of the future
 are going to be,
 and how much we wanna trust the big institutions
 that have been the pillars of society in the past,
 experimenting along these lines
 seems really, really valuable to me.
 I wanna say thanks again, Obi, to coming on the show,
 and thanks to the whole FedE team
 for their work in these great experiments.
 Of course, I also wanna thank my sponsor,
 In Wolf's Clothing, Wolf,
 the first startup accelerator for Bitcoin and Lightning.
 And finally, I wanna thank you guys, the listeners.
 I hope you are having a great Memorial Day weekend,
 and until next time, let's build.
