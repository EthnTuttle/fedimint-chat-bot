Expand description

This module defines a binary encoding interface which is more suitable for consensus critical encoding than e.g. bincode. Over
time all structs that need to be encoded to binary will be migrated to this interface.


MODULES

as_hex [as_hex/index.html]


STRUCTS

BigSize [struct.BigSize.html]
Lightning TLV uses a custom variable-length integer called BigSize. It is similar to Bitcoin’s variable-length integers except
that it is serialized in big-endian instead of little-endian.
CountWrite [struct.CountWrite.html]
A writer counting number of writes written to it
DecodeError [struct.DecodeError.html]


ENUMS

DynRawFallback [enum.DynRawFallback.html]
A type that decodes module_instance_id-prefixed Ts even when corresponding Decoder is not available.


TRAITS

Decodable [trait.Decodable.html]
Data which can be encoded in a consensus-consistent way
DynEncodable [trait.DynEncodable.html]
Object-safe trait for things that can encode themselves
Encodable [trait.Encodable.html]
Data which can be encoded in a consensus-consistent way


DERIVE MACROS

Decodable [derive.Decodable.html]
Encodable [derive.Encodable.html]
UnzipConsensus [derive.UnzipConsensus.html]
