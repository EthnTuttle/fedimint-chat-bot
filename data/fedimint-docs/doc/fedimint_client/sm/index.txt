util [util/index.html]


STRUCTS

ActiveState [struct.ActiveState.html]
ClientSMDatabaseTransaction [struct.ClientSMDatabaseTransaction.html]
A transaction that acts as isolated for module code but can be accessed as a normal transaction in this crate.
DynContext [struct.DynContext.html]
A shared context for a module client state machine
DynState [struct.DynState.html]

Executor [struct.Executor.html]
Executor that drives forward state machines under its management.
ExecutorBuilder [struct.ExecutorBuilder.html]
Builder to which module clients can be attached and used to build an Executor [struct.Executor.html] supporting these.
