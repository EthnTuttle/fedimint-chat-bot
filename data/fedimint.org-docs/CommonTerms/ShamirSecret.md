Where users need to back up data or keys to the federation, Fedimint utilizes the popular and time tested algorithm for [Shamir Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing). 

This allows data to be broken up into discrete shards, which can be placed with different parties and reassembled only if a threshold of the shards can be found.
